# verify-base-contract.sh — assert the contract that scion-base and the harness
# images rely on from whatever image sits beneath them.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# scion-base can be built on top of either core-base (the Debian chain) or
# thick-prep (the Cloud Workstations chain; see scripts/lib/targets.sh, where
# `thick` is thick-prep -> scion-base and therefore never passes through
# core-base). Everything scion-base needs from the layer below it used to be
# provided by convention and verified by nobody. Writing the contract down found
# four violations of it, all live at the time of writing:
#
#   * git     — core-base provided >= 2.48, thick-prep provided whatever Ubuntu
#     shipped (2.43). Every thick image silently lost worktree-per-agent mode.
#   * gh      — scion-base only installs its token-injecting wrapper when it
#     finds /usr/bin/gh. When core-base moved gh to /usr/local/bin the wrapper
#     stopped being installed on that chain, with no error anywhere.
#   * gcsfuse — provided by core-base, never installed by thick-prep, so GCS
#     volume mounts (pkg/runtime/common.go) fail at runtime on every thick image.
#   * NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX — exported by core-base, never by thick-prep, so the
#     npm-global directory scion-base chowns is unused on the thick chain and
#     `npm install -g` fails on permissions instead.
#
# All four are the same defect: an inherited assumption with no assertion. This
# script is the assertion. Every base that scion-base is built on must pass it,
# so a divergence fails a build instead of quietly degrading an agent.
#
# Every check below names a concrete consumer. Do not add a check without one —
# an unjustified requirement here becomes an unnecessary install over there.
#
# Usage: verify-base-contract.sh
#   GO_MIN_VERSION   minimum acceptable Go (default 1.26.1; see go.mod)
#   NODE_MIN_VERSION minimum acceptable Node major (default 24)
#   TARGETARCH       BuildKit automatic arg — the arch being built (e.g. arm64)
#   BUILDARCH        BuildKit automatic arg — the arch doing the building
#
# When TARGETARCH and BUILDARCH differ the leg is running under qemu-user, and
# the few checks that emulation cannot support are skipped with a printed
# reason. Both unset (running the script inside a finished container) means
# native, and everything runs.
#
# All checks are network-free. All failures are collected and reported together:
# seeing every violation in one build beats fixing them one round-trip at a time.

# --- Emulation awareness ----------------------------------------------------
#
# Multi-arch builds run the non-native leg under qemu-user, where some things
# genuinely cannot work no matter how correct the image is. qemu-user does not
# implement ptrace, so anything depending on it (chromium's crashpad, and by
# extension its whole multi-process startup) aborts. A check that cannot pass
# in the environment it runs in does not measure the image; it measures the
# emulator, and it fails every multi-arch build.
#
# BuildKit supplies TARGETARCH and BUILDARCH as automatic build args; the
# Dockerfiles forward them. When they differ, this leg is emulated.
#
# Defaults are deliberate: with neither set — running the script inside a
# finished container to re-check a live image, which is a supported use — this
# is real hardware, so EMULATED is false and every check runs. Assuming native
# is the safe default, because the cost of being wrong is a spurious failure
# that gets investigated, not a defect that ships.
