# install-core-toolchain.sh — bring an arbitrary Linux base up to the state that
# scion-base expects (see verify-base-contract.sh for the contract itself).
#
# WHY A SCRIPT AND NOT TWO DOCKERFILES
#
# scion-base is built on core-base (Debian, from scratch) or on thick-prep
# (Google Cloud Workstations, Ubuntu, already full of tooling). Those two
# started as independent recipes, drifted, and the drift was invisible: the
# thick chain shipped git 2.43 against a hard 2.47 requirement for as long as
# nobody looked. One script run by both chains makes drift impossible to
# express — there is only one recipe.
#
# RECONCILE, DON'T INSTALL
#
# Every step asks what the base already provides before doing anything:
#
#   * Present and adequate -> leave it alone. The Cloud Workstations base
#     already ships gcloud, kubectl and Go; reinstalling them wastes build time
#     and leaves two copies at different paths for PATH order to arbitrate.
#   * Present but too old  -> replace it, and say so.
#   * Absent               -> install it.
#
# Versions are floors, never equality. These base images are used for far more
# than building scion, so a base that ships a NEWER Go than go.mod declares is
# fine and is deliberately left alone: Go builds a module whose `go` directive
# is older without complaint, and pinning the image down to go.mod would
# degrade every other consumer of the image to serve one of them.
#
# CAPABILITY DETECTION, NOT DISTRO DETECTION
#
# Where the two bases differ (chromium has no apt candidate on Ubuntu) the test
# is for the capability — "does apt offer this package?" — not for the distro
# name. A third base then works without a third branch.
#
# Usage: install-core-toolchain.sh <step> [args]
# Steps are invoked individually by the Dockerfiles rather than via `all` so
# each remains its own cacheable layer.

# is the case in point: it is a virtual name satisfied by `chromium-browser`, a

# so asking the installable question there silently produces a browserless
