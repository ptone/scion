# Image Build

Dockerfiles and build configurations for Scion container images.

`image-build/` is focused on Scion-owned base and server images. Harness-specific
images are recipes attached to Harness-config bundles under `harnesses/<name>/`.
The build scripts can still build those harness images for a workstation or a
private registry, but the catalog is the source of truth for their Dockerfiles.

## Image Hierarchy

```
core-base          System dependencies (Go, Node, Python)
  └── scion-base   Adds sciontool binary and scion user
        ├── harness images  Optional recipes from harnesses/<name>/
        └── hub             Scion hub server

thick-prep         Patches Cloud Workstations base for scion compatibility,
                   including git >= 2.47 (amd64 only)
  └── scion-base   Same Dockerfile, different foundation
        ├── harness images
        └── hub
```

`core-base/`, `scion-base/`, and `hub/` live under `image-build/`. Harness images
build from self-contained bundles under `harnesses/<name>/` when that bundle has
a `Dockerfile` and `cloudbuild.yaml`. See
[`harnesses/README.md`](../harnesses/README.md).

### Where git comes from

Scion hard-requires **git >= 2.47.0** (`pkg/util/git.go` `CheckGitVersion`, for
`git worktree add --relative-paths`). Below that, worktree-per-agent mode is
disabled.

`scion-base` does **not** install git — it only builds the Go binaries — so git
is always inherited from whichever foundation is underneath it. Both foundations
therefore have to provide it independently:

| Foundation | Base OS | glibc | git |
|---|---|---|---|
| `core-base` | `node:24-trixie-slim` (Debian 13) | 2.41 | vendored from `chainguard/git` |
| `thick-prep` | Cloud Workstations base (Ubuntu 24.04) | 2.39 | vendored from `chainguard/git` |

Both copy the same four artifacts out of the Chainguard image. Two constraints
apply to that copy and are enforced by a build-time assertion in each Dockerfile:

- helpers **must** land in `/usr/libexec/git-core` — that path is compiled into
  the binary as `GIT_EXEC_PATH`, and getting it wrong produces a misleading
  `'remote-https' is not a git command`;
- the binary **must** land at `/usr/bin/git`, overwriting any distro git.
  Chainguard ships `/usr/libexec/git-core/git` as a relative symlink to
  `../../bin/git`, and git re-execs itself through that path for internal
  subcommands. On a base that already has its own `/usr/bin/git` (the thick
  base has 2.43), installing ours elsewhere leaves that symlink resolving to
  the **old** binary — `git --version` reports 2.55.0 while subcommands die
  with `fatal: unknown repository extension found: relativeworktrees`;
- the base image needs **glibc >= 2.38**. Debian bookworm (2.36) fails at exec
  with `GLIBC_2.38 not found`, so this gates any future base-image change.

`GIT_IMAGE` defaults to the floating `chainguard/git:latest`. Pin it to a digest
in CI (`--build-arg GIT_IMAGE=chainguard/git@sha256:...`) and refresh on a
schedule — a vendored binary stops receiving Chainguard's rebuild cadence the
moment it is copied out.

## Scripts

All image-related scripts live under `scripts/`. GitHub Actions workflows remain in `.github/workflows/` per GitHub convention.

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `scripts/build-images.sh` | Orchestrator. Build images via a pluggable backend (`--builder`). |
| `scripts/builders/*.sh` | Backend adapters (local-docker, local-podman, cloud-build). |
| `scripts/lib/targets.sh` | Target → step list resolution. Single source of truth for the build DAG. |
| `scripts/trigger-cloudbuild.sh` | Deprecation shim. Forwards to `build-images.sh --builder cloud-build`. |
| `scripts/pull-containers.sh` | Pull pre-built images (auto-detects runtime). |
| `scripts/setup-cloud-build.sh` | One-time GCP setup (APIs, Artifact Registry, permissions). |
| `.github/workflows/build-images.yml` | GitHub Actions workflow for building and pushing images. |

### Builders

`build-images.sh` selects an execution backend with `--builder <name>`. Three are bundled:

| Builder | Backend | Multi-arch | Push behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| `local-docker` (default) | `docker buildx` | yes (auto-promotes to `--push`) | honors `--push`; `--load` otherwise |
| `local-podman` | `podman build` | single-arch by default; multi-arch errors out (manual QEMU setup required) | honors `--push`; built images live in the local store automatically |
| `cloud-build` | `gcloud builds submit` against a static `cloudbuild-*.yaml` | always amd64+arm64 (server-side) | always pushes |

The orchestrator owns target sequencing, tag computation, and BASE_IMAGE threading. Each builder only knows how to execute one image build (per-image mode) or one target submission (target mode).

### Targets

| Target | What gets built | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `core-base` | `core-base` | Foundation tools layer. |
| `scion-base` | `scion-base` | Adds sciontool. Uses existing `core-base:<tag>`. |
| `harnesses` | All catalog harness images with `harnesses/<name>/Dockerfile` | Uses existing `scion-base:<tag>`. Builds recipes from the root Harness-config catalog. |
| `hub` | `scion-hub` | Hub server image. Uses existing `scion-base:<tag>`. |
| `omni` | `scion-omni` | Single-node deployment image: selected harnesses (claude, codex, opencode, antigravity, grok-build) chained into one image with embedded web UI. amd64 only. |
| `common` (default) | `scion-base` + catalog harnesses + hub | Skips `core-base`. Most common rebuild. |
| `all` | Full DAG | Rebuilds everything from `core-base`. |
| `thick-prep` | `thick-prep` | Prep layer for thick base. amd64 only. |
| `thick` | `thick-prep` + `scion-base` + catalog harnesses + hub | Full thick rebuild using Cloud Workstations base instead of `core-base`. amd64 only. |

### Tagging

Every image is tagged with both `:<tag>` (controlled by `--tag`, defaults to `latest`) and `:<short-sha>` (computed once from `git rev-parse --short HEAD`). When no SHA is available (e.g. running outside a git working tree), only the mutable tag is emitted.

When two steps in the same run depend on each other, the orchestrator threads `BASE_IMAGE=...:<short-sha>` so chained builds are immune to concurrent overwrites of `:latest`. Standalone targets (e.g. `--target harnesses` on its own) reference the parent image as `:<tag>`.

### Quick Start: Build Your Own Images

```bash
# Build locally without ever pushing — bare tags (scion-base:latest,
# scion-claude:latest, etc.)
# land in your local engine's image store. Default builder: local-docker.
image-build/scripts/build-images.sh --target all

# Build locally, auto-detecting the registry from SCION_IMAGE_REGISTRY so
# images are tagged with the prefix the hub expects (e.g., scion-local/scion-claude:latest).
# No --registry flag needed when the env var is already set.
SCION_IMAGE_REGISTRY=scion-local image-build/scripts/build-images.sh --target all

# Same, with Podman
image-build/scripts/build-images.sh --builder local-podman --target all

# Build and push to your registry (default builder: local-docker)
image-build/scripts/build-images.sh --registry ghcr.io/myorg --push

# Submit to Cloud Build (--registry is required here)
image-build/scripts/build-images.sh --builder cloud-build \
  --registry us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/myproj/scion --target all

# Preview what would run, without executing
image-build/scripts/build-images.sh --target all --platform all --dry-run

# Configure scion to use the images you built (only when pushing to a registry)
scion config set image_registry ghcr.io/myorg
```

`--registry` is optional for local builds without `--push`; it's required when
`--push` is set or when using `--builder cloud-build`. When omitted, the script
falls back to the `SCION_IMAGE_REGISTRY` environment variable so that locally-built
images automatically match the hub's configured registry prefix.

### Quick Start: Google Cloud Build

```bash
# One-time setup
image-build/scripts/setup-cloud-build.sh --project my-project

# Trigger a build
image-build/scripts/build-images.sh --builder cloud-build \
  --registry us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/public-docker
```

The legacy `trigger-cloudbuild.sh` script still works as a deprecation shim and forwards to the orchestrator.

### Quick Start: GitHub Actions (GHCR)

1. Fork the repo.
2. Go to **Actions** > **Build Scion Images** > **Run workflow**.
3. Enter `ghcr.io/<your-username>` as the registry.
4. Run `scion config set image_registry ghcr.io/<your-username>`.

The workflow shells out to `build-images.sh --builder local-docker`. It is also available as a reusable workflow via `workflow_call` for use in downstream repos.

## Cloud Build Configs

The `cloud-build` builder maps each `--target` to a static YAML file:

| Target | Config file |
|---|---|
| `all` | `cloudbuild.yaml` |
| `common` | `cloudbuild-common.yaml` |
| `core-base` | `cloudbuild-core-base.yaml` |
| `scion-base` | `cloudbuild-scion-base.yaml` |
| `harnesses` | `cloudbuild-harnesses.yaml` |
| `hub` | `cloudbuild-hub.yaml` |
| `omni` | `cloudbuild-omni.yaml` |
| `thick-prep` | `cloudbuild-thick-prep.yaml` |
| `thick` | `cloudbuild-thick.yaml` |

`--target thick-prep` builds only thick-prep under every builder. Until
2026-09 it mapped to `cloudbuild-thick.yaml` — the same file as `thick` — so
under `cloud-build` it built and pushed all eleven thick-chain images. That is
fixed; the note that used to document the divergence is gone because the
divergence is gone.

The orchestrator prints what the selected config will actually write before it
submits, so the blast radius of a target is visible without reading the YAML:

```
$ ./scripts/build-images.sh --builder cloud-build --target thick-prep --dry-run
Config:   cloudbuild-thick-prep.yaml (4 steps)
Pushes:   1 image(s): thick-prep
```

The `Pushes:` line counts `-t` tag arguments only, so a
`--build-arg BASE_IMAGE=...` reference to an image the config does not write
is not counted.

**Builder divergence for `omni`:** Under `cloud-build`, the omni target builds the
full chain from `thick-prep` (amd64 only, no buildx cache); under `local-docker`,
it chains from whatever `scion-base:<tag>` already exists. Same target name, two
lineages. The `cloud-build` path uses `gcloudignore-omni` to include web source
files that the default `.gcloudignore` excludes (the omni Dockerfile runs
`npm install && npm run build` to embed the web frontend).

These YAMLs reference `$_TAG`, `$_SHORT_SHA`, `$_COMMIT_SHA`, and `$_REGISTRY` substitutions, all forwarded by the orchestrator.

The aggregate `cloudbuild-harnesses.yaml`, `cloudbuild-common.yaml`, and
`cloudbuild.yaml` files are static snapshots of the current catalog. When adding
or removing a harness Dockerfile under `harnesses/<name>/`, update those
aggregate YAMLs too. Individual harness bundles can also carry their own
`harnesses/<name>/cloudbuild.yaml` for one-off builds.

## Package Registries

By default the images install packages from the public npm registry and PyPI. On
a network where `registry.npmjs.org` or `pypi.org` is unreachable, point the
build at internal mirrors (Artifactory, Nexus, Verdaccio, devpi) with four
optional environment variables:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `NPM_REGISTRY` | npm registry URL. Passed to `core-base` as a build-arg and exported as `NPM_CONFIG_REGISTRY`, so `scion-base`, the harness images, and agents at runtime all inherit it. |
| `NPM_CONFIG_FILE` | Path to an `.npmrc` holding credentials for that registry. Mounted as a BuildKit secret, never written to an image layer. |
| `PIP_INDEX_URL` | Python package index URL. Same handling: a `core-base` build-arg, exported as `PIP_INDEX_URL` and inherited the same way. Used by the `hermes` image, and by anything an agent pip-installs at runtime. |
| `PIP_CONFIG_FILE` | Path to a `pip.conf` holding credentials for that index. Mounted as a BuildKit secret at `/etc/pip.conf`. |

```bash
export NPM_REGISTRY=https://artifactory.example.com/artifactory/api/npm/npm-repos/
export NPM_CONFIG_FILE="$HOME/.npmrc"
export PIP_INDEX_URL=https://artifactory.example.com/artifactory/api/pypi/pypi-repos/simple
export PIP_CONFIG_FILE="$HOME/.config/pip/pip.conf"
image-build/scripts/build-images.sh --target common
```

A minimal `pip.conf` for an index requiring basic auth:

```ini
[global]
index-url = https://USER:TOKEN@artifactory.example.com/artifactory/api/pypi/pypi-repos/simple
```

All four are optional and independent. Unset, the build uses the public
registries unauthenticated, exactly as before. `NPM_REGISTRY` or
`PIP_INDEX_URL` without its credentials file works for a mirror that allows
anonymous reads.

Put credentials in the secret file rather than in `PIP_INDEX_URL`: that variable
is baked into the image as `ENV`, so a token embedded in the URL would persist
in the image and show up in `docker inspect`.

Credentials go in as a BuildKit secret rather than a build-arg deliberately: a
build-arg is recoverable from `docker history` on the resulting image, whereas a
secret mount is available only during the `RUN` that requests it. The mounts are
declared `required=false`, so builds without a secret are unaffected.

Supported by the `local-docker` and `local-podman` builders.

**Still not covered:** apt. The `hermes` image installs Node.js from
`deb.nodesource.com` via an apt source, which no build-arg here redirects. A host
that blocks that domain will fail on that layer regardless of the index settings
above.

## Authentication

The orchestrator and builders assume the caller is already authenticated to the target registry (via `docker login`, `podman login`, `gcloud auth configure-docker`, etc.) and to any required cloud APIs. No login steps are performed inside the script.
