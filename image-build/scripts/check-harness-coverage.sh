# Guard: every default harness in harnesses/<name>/Dockerfile must have a
# build step in each "full catalog" Cloud Build config, and that step must
# push a matching scion-<name> image.
#
# ptone/scion#2357: harnesses/muse-code existed in the tree but was absent
# from cloudbuild-harnesses.yaml, so a deployment that publishes only the
# Cloud Build output got image-pull failures for scion-muse-code. The
# per-image builders (local-docker, local-podman) never had this problem --
# lib/targets.sh's discover_harness_names() walks harnesses/ at build time.
# The cloudbuild-*.yaml files are static snapshots gcloud requires up front
# (see image-build/README.md, "Cloud Build Configs"), so nothing forced them
# to stay in sync with the catalog. This script is that sync check, and it
# is run in CI (.github/workflows/ci.yml, "Check Harness Coverage in Cloud
# Build Configs") so it can't silently drift again.
#
# Beyond presence, a step's `dir: harnesses/<name>` alone does not guarantee
# it builds the right image: a step copy-pasted from another harness could
# keep the old harness's `-t ...scion-<name>:$_TAG` args. This script also
# flags that mismatch (see the MISMATCH: handling below).
#
# Checked files ("full catalog" configs -- every default harness must
# appear):
#   - cloudbuild.yaml            ("Full rebuild" header)
#   - cloudbuild-common.yaml     ("Common rebuild" header)
#   - cloudbuild-harnesses.yaml  (harnesses-only rebuild)
#   - cloudbuild-thick.yaml      ("Thick base full rebuild" header)
#
# Deliberately NOT checked: cloudbuild-omni.yaml. Its own header documents
# it as "a deliberate subset of harnesses for single-node deployment" and
# names the exact chain (_OMNI_CHAIN in scripts/lib/targets.sh); it is
# expected to omit harnesses and is exempt by design, not by oversight.
#
# Usage:
#   image-build/scripts/check-harness-coverage.sh
#
# Requires a Python 3 interpreter with PyYAML. Set PYTHON=/path/to/python3
# to override, same convention as scripts/single-node-vm/check-cloud-init.sh.

# Pin collation for `sort` and `comm` below: one input list is sorted by this

# differently between the two, which makes `comm` warn about unsorted input
# and can report false missing/extra entries.
