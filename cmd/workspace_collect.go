// collectWorkspaceFiles collects the files of a local workspace for a hub
// workspace transfer: the non-git workspace bootstrap upload, `scion sync to`,
// and the local comparison set for `scion sync from` (so it matches what an
// upload would send). It applies transfer.DefaultExcludePatterns, which keep
// .git and the workspace-root .scion entry out of the transfer, plus extra.
//
// The root .scion entry is project metadata for the host it lives on and is
// never part of a workspace transfer. If a collected path is the root .scion
// entry or lies under it (for example because the defaults were changed),
// the collect fails instead of returning it.
//
// Every workspace collect in this package goes through here. A source guard
// test resolves the pkg/transfer and pkg/hubclient imports by import path in
// each file, so it fails if any other call site uses their CollectFiles or
// ManifestBuilder (under any import name), or if either package is dot- or
// blank-imported; only the listed template and harness-config uploads may use
// hubclient.CollectFiles.
