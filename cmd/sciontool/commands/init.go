It provides:
  - Zombie process reaping (critical for PID 1)
  - Signal forwarding to child processes
  - Graceful shutdown with configurable grace period
  - Child process exit code propagation

The command after -- is executed as the child process. If no command is
specified, sciontool will exit with an error.

	// true — that behaviour is unchanged.
	//
	// It must be false when RunInit is invoked in-process by
	// `sciontool substrate-serve` (pkg/sciontool/substrate). substrate-serve
	// is itself PID 1 there and owns SIGTERM handling: Phase 1 requires it
	// to log SIGTERM without forwarding it (see substrate-runtime.md §5.6 —
	// full eviction handling is Phase 2). If RunInit also
	// installed a SIGTERM handler in that mode, the two handlers would race
	// on the same process signal and the harness could be killed anyway.
	ForwardTermSignal bool

	// RequirePrivilegeDrop fails RunInit closed — refusing to start the
	// harness — when setupHostUser could not actually drop from root to
	// the scion user (e.g. the container's capability set lacks
	// CAP_SETUID/CAP_SETGID). Substrate always starts the actor process as
	// UID 0 (agent-substrate/substrate's ContainerSpec has no user field),
	// so unlike a container runtime where staying at UID 0 can legitimately
	// mean "already unprivileged" (rootless Podman/keep-id — see
	// setupHostUser), on substrate it can only mean the drop never
	// happened, and scion never runs the harness or exec as root.
	//
	// This is set only by `sciontool substrate-serve`'s InitRunner
	// (cmd/sciontool/commands/substrate_serve.go), never by an environment
	// variable a workload could set itself, and it does not change

	// fallback (rootless Podman relies on it) is unchanged; this only adds
	// a check of its result.

	// and every runtime other than substrate.
	//
	// Superseded outright by ResolveWorkingDir below when both are set: its
	// result is what reaches the harness, and this field is ignored. No
	// caller sets both today — substrate-serve's InitRunner sets only
	// ResolveWorkingDir, and every other caller sets only WorkingDir, if
	// anything — so this precedence is a documented default for a future

	// derived here from SCION_RUNTIME or any other sniffing: RunInit stays a
	// plain function of this field, exactly like RequirePrivilegeDrop above.
	// Substrate is the one runtime that needs it because its ateapi
	// Container spec has no workingDir field and ateom does not apply the
	// image's WorkingDir, so — unlike Docker/Podman/Kubernetes, which all
	// get the correct cwd from the image's WORKDIR for free — this
	// process's own cwd is not already correct by the time RunInit runs
	// (see substrateServeInitOptions's doc comment for how the value is
	// resolved, including the $HOME fallback).

	// ResolveWorkingDir, when non-nil, is called once by RunInit — directly
	// after gitCloneWorkspace and the post-pre-start-hook ownership fixup
	// have both run, and before anything else that starts a long-running
	// component on the harness's behalf (sidecar services, the metadata
	// server, the hub secret fetch) or before harnessSupervisorConfig builds
	// the supervisor.Config — to compute the harness child's working
	// directory in place of the static WorkingDir field above.
	//
	// That placement is not incidental: a resolver that needs to know
	// whether a directory is actually usable (searchable by the scion
	// uid/gid) has to run after every step that can change that, and before
	// any step whose work would be wasted (and, on the fail-closed exit
	// path, left running) if the resolver then errors. gitCloneWorkspace's
	// ensureWorkspaceOwnership chowns the workspace to the scion uid (or
	// creates it via git init in the first place); the ownership fixup that
	// follows pre-start hooks chowns any root-owned files a provisioner left
	// behind. Those are the two steps a resolver's usability check depends
	// on; nothing after them changes it. A resolver called before both has
	// seen the workspace in whatever state the broker's bind mount left it
	// in: for a fresh git-clone agent, root-owned and not yet searchable by
	// the scion uid, which resolves to the wrong directory.
