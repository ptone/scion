// fixupRootfsForScion corrects three observed conditions in a Substrate
// actor's rootfs that otherwise make dropping from root to the scion user
// impossible, or unsafe, no matter what capabilities the actor holds or how
// correctly SCION_HOST_UID/GID get applied:
//
//   - (i) '/' itself comes up too restrictive for the scion user to even
//     traverse into. agent-substrate/substrate's
//     internal/imagecache/bundle_linux.go (~lines 61-66) creates the
//     rootfs/upper/work directories with MkdirAll(..., 0o700), and the
//     actor's overlay root inherits the upperdir's own mode, so '/' comes
//     up 0700 root:root.
//   - (ii) image-layer files under $HOME are observed to be owned by uid 0
//     inside the actor, while runtime-created files are owned correctly;
//     the specific upstream mechanism is not identified. Either way the
//     effect is the same: the scion user can't read or write its own home
//     directory.
//   - (iii) /tmp and /var/tmp come up 0777 without the sticky bit, instead
//     of the 1777 their image layer (a Debian base) sets. The same
//     mode-bit-loss mechanism as (i) is suspected but not confirmed. A
//     shared, world-writable directory without the sticky bit lets any
//     process rename or delete another user's entries in it, and it also
//     turns off the kernel's protected_symlinks/protected_hardlinks
//     defenses, which only apply to sticky world-writable directories —
//     both matter here because this process, root, later creates and
//     opens predictable paths under /tmp on the scion user's behalf.
//
// It also corrects a fourth condition that isn't a rootfs oddity but a
// deliberate image posture this runtime alone can't tolerate:
//
//   - (iv) the image ships the scion user a passwordless sudo grant
//     (/etc/sudoers.d/scion, /etc/sudoers.d/scion-firewall — "scion
//     ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL") on the assumption that sudo's own setuid bit
//     never survives into a running actor. On a runtime where root is a
//     security boundary, if that assumption is ever violated — a stale
//     golden template, or a rootfs mechanism that restores setuid the same
//     way it's observed restoring ownership in (ii) — the grant plus an
//     intact setuid bit is a single, no-password command away from full
//     root. Every other runtime this codebase targets keeps sudo and its
//     setuid bit intact on purpose (root is not a security boundary there),
//     so this half of the fixup, like the rest of this function, only ever
//     runs from Substrate's own call sites.
//
// root and home are parameters — not hardcoded to "/" and a resolved
// $HOME — purely so a test can point them at a t.TempDir() standing in for
// the real rootfs and home directory. /tmp and /var/tmp are derived from
// root the same way, so a test root without either subdirectory just skips
// that part of the fixup (see fixupWorldWritableTmpDirSticky's doc comment).
//
// Idempotent: when none of the three conditions need fixing, this makes no
// changes. It always logs one debug line with the home walk's duration and
// entry count — including on a no-op call, since the /bootstrap call site
// hits this on every actor start and is by design a no-op once startup has
// already fixed things up, so that cost would otherwise never be
// measurable at all — and logs one additional info line, with what
// changed, only when something actually did.
