// attachCmd represents the attach command
var attachCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "attach <agent>",
	Short: "Attach to an agent's interactive session",
	Long: `Attach your terminal to the interactive tmux session of a running agent.

scion attach needs an interactive terminal on stdin and stdout. Without one
(for example when it runs from a script or a coding harness, or its output is
piped) it fails with an error and a non-zero exit, rather than returning
without attaching.

Detaching:
  Press Ctrl-b, then d (the tmux detach key). The agent keeps running and you
  can attach again later. The docker/podman default Ctrl-p Ctrl-q is not used,
  so Ctrl-p reaches the agent. Podman's detach keys are off. On docker they
  move to Ctrl-\ then Ctrl-^: a lone Ctrl-\ is delayed until the next key,
  and the full sequence ends the attach (the agent keeps running).

Local vs Hub mode:
  With a local project, scion attach runs the container runtime's exec on this
  machine. When the project is linked to a Hub, the session goes through the
  Hub to the runtime broker running the agent, over a WebSocket. Anyone with
  attach permission on the agent can attach. Several people can be attached at
  once and see the same session.

Disconnects:
  scion attach does not reconnect. If the connection to the Hub or the runtime
  broker drops, or the agent's session ends, the command exits with a message
  explaining what happened and what to run next (for example scion resume
  <agent> for a stopped agent, or scion attach <agent> to try again).`,
	Example: `  # Attach to a running agent; detach again with Ctrl-b d
  scion attach my-agent

  # Start or resume an agent and attach in one step
  scion start my-agent "task" --attach
  scion resume my-agent --attach`,

// The named profile's own Attach wins when the broker gave one (from

// broker-wide Capabilities.Attach, and THAT answer is final: true (or the

// supported, but an explicit broker-wide false means not, even though the
// specific profile itself said nothing. A profile carrying no signal is not

// broker whose default runtime opts out of attach is refused before
// dialing even though that specific profile's own runtime might support
// it fine — an accepted, documented cost of not being able to ask a
// specific profile's own runtime without a live instance for it (see
// pkg/runtimebroker's resolver and its own equivalent unknown-profile
// cases): a silent profile on a broker whose broker-wide Capabilities.Attach
// is false refuses.
//
// No broker ID on the agent record defaults to supported: there is nothing
// to read in that case, unlike a broker that answered but had nothing to
// say about that particular profile, and the server-side gate stays the
// authoritative check regardless. A broker ID that neither the point-GET
// nor the LIST fallback could resolve to a record also comes back
// unreadable, for the same reason a 403/404 on either read does: the caller
