	Short:   "Manage the Runtime Broker",
	Long: `Commands for managing this host as a Runtime Broker.

A Runtime Broker is a compute node that executes agents on behalf of the Hub.
Brokers register with the Hub and can be added as providers for projects.

Note: This command was previously named "broker". The old name still works
but is deprecated. Please use "scion runtime-broker" instead.

Commands:
  status       Show broker status (server, registration, projects)
  start        Start the broker server (as daemon by default)
  stop         Stop the broker daemon
  restart      Stop and restart the broker daemon
  register     Register this host as a Runtime Broker with the Hub
  deregister   Remove this broker from the Hub
  hubs         List hub connections
  provide      Add this broker as a provider for a project
  withdraw     Remove this broker as a provider from a project`,

var brokerRegisterCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "register",
	Short: "Register this host as a Runtime Broker with the Hub",
	Long: `Register this host as a Runtime Broker with the Hub.

This command registers your machine as a compute node that can execute
agents on behalf of the Hub. Once registered, the Hub can dispatch
agent operations to this broker.

Prerequisites:
- The broker server must be running (scion runtime-broker start)
- The Hub endpoint must be configured
- You must be authenticated with the Hub: a sign-in (scion hub auth login),
  or a hub-boundary user access token carrying broker:create (and
  broker:read) in SCION_HUB_TOKEN. Either way, your user must hold
  broker.create, which hub members do.

The broker is owned by the signed-in user, or by the token's user.
Re-registering an existing broker requires its owner, or a super-admin
with a sign-in (a token re-registers only a broker its user created).
Registration never associates the broker with a project: the owner runs
'scion runtime-broker provide' for each project the broker should serve.

This command will:
1. Verify the local broker server is running
2. Create a broker registration on the Hub
3. Complete the two-phase join process
4. Save broker credentials for future authentication

Examples:
  # Register this host as a broker
  scion runtime-broker register

  # Register a headless host with a hub-boundary token
  SCION_HUB_ENDPOINT=https://hub.example.com SCION_HUB_TOKEN=scion_pat_... \
    scion runtime-broker register -y

  # Force re-registration even if already registered
  scion runtime-broker register --force

  # Register with auto-provide enabled (requires broker.auto_provide)
  scion runtime-broker register --auto-provide

  # Register under a custom broker name instead of the hostname, for
  # example when running several brokers on one host. The name is saved
  # in the global settings and used by later commands and by the broker.
  scion runtime-broker register --broker-name build-host-2

  # Register a broker on a non-default port. Not needed when the broker
  # was started with 'scion runtime-broker start --port 19800': the port
  # used by the last start is the default.
  scion runtime-broker register --port 19800`,

// brokerDeregisterCmd removes this broker from the Hub
var brokerDeregisterCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "deregister",
	Short: "Remove this broker from the Hub",
	Long: `Remove this broker from the Hub.

This command will:
1. Remove this broker from all projects it provides for
2. Clear the stored broker token

Use --broker-only to only remove the broker record without affecting project providers.

Local state: deregister removes this hub's credentials file, its
hub_connections entry and (when no connections remain) the empty
hub-credentials/ directory. Broker-local state stays: the broker daemon log
(broker.log), the broker's state directory (runtime-broker-state/<broker-id>)
and the broker template cache (cache/templates). Pass --purge-local to remove
them as well once the last hub connection is gone and the broker is stopped;
it also works on a host that is no longer registered. When the purge cannot
run, the command exits non-zero (after a successful deregister) and says why.
Only the default locations are cleaned: a broker run with a custom state or
template cache directory keeps those. Settings files, the hub-id file (it
belongs to a local hub) and other hubs' credentials are never removed.`,

// brokerStartCmd starts the broker server
var brokerStartCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "start",
	Short: "Start the Runtime Broker server",
	Long: `Start the Runtime Broker server.

By default, the broker starts as a background daemon. Use --foreground
to run in the current terminal session.

The broker server provides an API for agent lifecycle management and
communicates with the Hub for coordination.

Examples:
  # Start broker as daemon (background)
  scion runtime-broker start

  # Start broker in foreground
  scion runtime-broker start --foreground

  # Start broker on custom port
  scion runtime-broker start --port 9801

  # Start broker with auto-provide enabled

// brokerProvideCmd adds this broker as a provider for a project
var brokerProvideCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "provide",
	Short: "Add a broker as a provider for a project",
	Long: `Add a broker as a provider for a project.

When a broker is a provider for a project, it can execute agents
for that project. The Hub will dispatch agent operations to the
broker when agents are created in the project.

If --project is not specified, uses the current local project.
If --broker is not specified, uses the local broker registration.

Providing a broker requires update permission on the project and the
broker owner's consent: the caller must be the broker's owner or a
super-admin. Once provided, members of the project can run agents on it.

Use --make-default to set the broker as the default for the project. If the
project already has a different default broker, you will be prompted to confirm
the change.

Examples:
  # Add local broker as provider for current project
  scion runtime-broker provide

  # Add local broker as provider for a specific project. No local path is
  # sent: an existing provider path for this broker is kept (a stored
  # global-directory path is cleared), otherwise the broker uses its
  # hub-managed project directory.
  scion runtime-broker provide --project <project-id>

  # Add local broker as provider for a project linked to a local checkout
  scion runtime-broker provide --project <project-id> --path /path/to/checkout

  # Add a remote broker as provider for a project (its owner or a super-admin)
  scion runtime-broker provide --broker <broker-id> --project <project-id>

  # Add broker as provider and set as default
  scion runtime-broker provide --make-default`,
	RunE: runBrokerProvide,
}

// brokerWithdrawCmd removes this broker as a provider from a project
var brokerWithdrawCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "withdraw",
	Short: "Remove a broker as a provider from a project",
	Long: `Remove a broker as a provider from a project.

After withdrawing, the broker will no longer receive agent dispatch
requests for the project. Existing agents on the broker will continue
running but cannot be managed through the Hub until the broker is
re-added as a provider.

If --project is not specified, uses the current local project.
If --broker is not specified, uses the local broker registration.

Examples:
  # Remove local broker as provider from current project
  scion runtime-broker withdraw

  # Remove local broker as provider from a specific project
  scion runtime-broker withdraw --project <project-id>

  # Remove a remote broker as provider from a project (admin only)

	Short: "List hub connections",

Credentials are stored in ~/.scion/hub-credentials/.

Examples:
  # List all hub connections
  scion runtime-broker hubs

  # List hub connections in JSON format
  scion runtime-broker hubs --json`,
	RunE: runBrokerHubs,
}

// brokerStatusCmd shows the current broker status
var brokerStatusCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "status",
	Short: "Show Runtime Broker status",
	Long: `Show the current status of a Runtime Broker.

This command displays:
- Whether the broker server is running (daemon or foreground)
- Hub registration status
- Projects this broker provides for
- Connection status to the Hub

If --broker is not specified, shows the local broker status.
If --broker is specified, queries the Hub for the remote broker's status.

Examples:
  # Show local broker status
  scion runtime-broker status

  # Show local broker status in JSON format
  scion runtime-broker status --json

  # Show status of a remote broker
  scion runtime-broker status --broker <broker-id>`,
	RunE: runBrokerStatus,
}

// brokerStopCmd stops the broker daemon
var brokerStopCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "stop",
	Short: "Stop the Runtime Broker daemon",
	Long: `Stop the Runtime Broker daemon.

This command stops the broker server if it's running as a daemon.
If the broker is running in foreground mode, use Ctrl+C to stop it.

Examples:
  # Stop the broker daemon
  scion runtime-broker stop`,
	RunE: runBrokerStop,
}

// brokerRestartCmd restarts the broker daemon
var brokerRestartCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "restart",
	Short: "Restart the Runtime Broker daemon",
	Long: `Restart the Runtime Broker daemon.

This command stops the currently running broker daemon and starts a new one
using the current scion binary. This is useful after installing a new version
of scion to pick up the updated binary.

If the broker is not running as a daemon, this command will return an error.

The new daemon keeps the --port, --auto-provide and --debug values the
running daemon was started with, unless you pass them again.

Examples:
  # Restart the broker daemon
  scion runtime-broker restart

  # Restart with a different port
  scion runtime-broker restart --port 9801

  # Restart with auto-provide enabled
  scion runtime-broker restart --auto-provide`,
