// The scion-hub Helm chart's claims about the hub, re-derived from the hub.
//
// WHY THIS FILE IS IN THE REPOSITORY AND NOT UNDER deploy/helm/. Two reasons,
// and only the second one is interesting.
//
// The mechanical reason: validateHostedHAPreflight, isHADeployment, hostedMode
// and enableHub are unexported, so a driver for them lives in package cmd or
// nowhere.
//
// The reason that matters: the chart's prose carried a list of eight preflight
// gates, written down three times - in templates/_helpers.tpl, in
// templates/NOTES.txt, and as the literal 8 in tests/render-guards.sh. The
// three agreed with each other and with nothing in the hub. gd-p1-rev then
// walked the same preflight and got NINE, because their walk supplied a
// malformed IAP audience where mine supplied a well-formed one, and the format
// check is a separate gate. The guard could not see the disagreement, because
// the guard and the claim shared the constant.
//
// So the list is not written down any more. It is DERIVED, here, by driving the
// real preflight over the settings.yaml the chart actually renders - pulled out
// of the chart's own committed golden files - and written to
// deploy/helm/scion-hub/hack/ha-gates.txt. The chart's shell suite checks its
// prose against that artifact. When Cloud SQL lands and renders
// server.database.url, this walk returns one fewer gate on its own and there is
// no constant for anyone to decrement.
//
// THE WALK'S OUTPUT IS A FUNCTION OF WHAT THE WALK SUPPLIES. That is the whole
// lesson of the eight-versus-nine, so every step below records the value it
// supplied, and an arm that cannot construct the next input says so rather than
// reporting a shorter list. "The probe ran out of moves" and "the hub ran out
// of gates" are different outcomes and a bare count cannot tell them apart.
