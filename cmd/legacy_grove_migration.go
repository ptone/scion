// pkg/runtimebroker.Server in-process; every other command under either
// subtree (status, stop, restart, install, migrate, register, provide, ...)
// never boots a server and must keep warning on stderr like any other CLI
// command, since it has no other hook to report through. `server restart`
// only ever spawns a *new* `server start --foreground` process rather than
// booting in-process itself, so it falls through here too (and that new
// process's own Execute() call resolves to "start" and is correctly caught
// there instead). `runtime-broker start` is always caught by name, in
// daemon mode too: its `--foreground` path calls serverStartCmd.RunE
// directly (cmd/broker.go), which bypasses PersistentPreRunE entirely but
// not Execute()'s check, since the top-level invoked command is still
// "runtime-broker start".
//
// The two boot commands report the legacy-env warning via their own
// slog-based hook (config.WarnRemovedLegacyEnvOnce) instead of this one. If
// the CLI hook also fired there, a combined `scion server start --enable-hub
// --enable-runtime-broker` process would warn on stderr *and* slog for the
// same variable, and — once real on-disk migration also runs through this
// same hook — the CLI hook would perform the migration and report it on
// stderr before the slog-based hooks ever ran, so the structured log records
// operators are told to watch for (subsystem=layout-migration) would never
// contain it.
