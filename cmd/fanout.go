// maxFanOutConcurrency caps how many per-recipient sends a group send or a
// broadcast runs at once, and how many agents stop --all and suspend --all
// act on at once (ptone/scion#3602). The broker limits concurrent dispatch
// and each message costs several runtime lookups, so an unbounded fan-out
// queues requests past the Hub's dispatch deadline (ptone/scion#3521); a
// handful in flight still overlaps request latency without flooding the
// dispatch path.

// boundedFanOut calls run(i) for every i in [0, n), in index order, with at
// most limit calls running at once, and returns once every call has
// returned. Calls are dispatched in index order, and none is dispatched once
// ctx is seen to be done. A dispatched call's goroutine may run late, so on
// an interrupt the indices whose work never started are not strictly the
// tail of the list; callers keep results by index instead of relying on it.
//
// Once ctx is done, no further call is started: skip(i) is called instead
// for each remaining index, without waiting for a free slot, so an interrupt
// never hangs on the limit. run must still check ctx itself, since ctx can
// end between a slot being taken and run starting its work.
//
// onQueued, if set, is called each time an index has to wait for a free
// slot (tests use it to observe that the limit is reached).
