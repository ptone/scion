# Scion HA deployment: Terraform

Terraform for the Cloud Run hub + IAP, Cloud SQL Postgres, GKE Autopilot
runtime, Filestore NFS pattern, with multiple hubs sharing one project's
infra. See the design doc (`conv:5e2bb789-a863-45ec-a45c-b221904f7e1b`,
fork issue `ptone/scion#1840`) for the full rationale; this README covers
what an operator needs to actually run it.

**Status: phase 1.** This is the minimum vertical slice, validated once
end-to-end (`tfha` / `ptone-emblem`). Phases 2-4 (HA hardening, modularity
seams, CI) are not implemented yet — see the design doc §7.

## Layout

```
modules/
  project-services/ network/ cloudsql-instance/ filestore/ gke-autopilot/
  artifact-registry/          # shared layer
  shared-lookup/ cloudsql-database/ hub-identity/ agent-runtime-k8s/
  hub-cloudrun/                # hub layer
configurations/
  shared-infra/   # apply once per project
  hub/            # apply once per hub
```

Modules declare no `provider` or `backend` blocks — only the two
`configurations/*` roots do. The hub root never manages shared infra; it only
reads it, by naming convention, through the `shared-lookup` module (no
`terraform_remote_state`).

## Prerequisites (manual, once per project)

1. A project with billing enabled. The operator (in `ptone-emblem`, this is
   **vm-deploy**) needs Owner or an equivalent role set covering: Editor,
   `roles/compute.networkAdmin`, `roles/container.admin`,
   `roles/run.admin`, `roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin`,
   `roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin`, `roles/servicenetworking.networksAdmin`,
   `roles/storage.admin`, `roles/iap.admin`. (`servicenetworking.networksAdmin`,
   `storage.admin` and `iap.admin` were still pending grant as of the phase 1
   validation — see `phase1-validation.md`.)
2. A GCS state bucket, versioned: `<project>-<name_prefix>-tfstate` (e.g.
   `ptone-emblem-tfha-tfstate`). Access limited to operators.
3. An IAP OAuth web client, created by hand in the console (the IAP OAuth
   Admin API no longer supports creating new clients via API/Terraform):
   - Application type: Web application.
   - Authorized redirect URI:
     `https://iap.googleapis.com/v1/oauth/clientIds/<CLIENT_ID>:handleRedirect`.
   - Store the client secret in Secret Manager (`<prefix>-oauth-client-secret`).
   - One client can serve every hub under a given `name_prefix`.
4. The hub image, built and pushed to the Artifact Registry repo that
   `shared-infra` creates. There is no single-apply bootstrap trick here (the
   two-root split already separates "create the repo" from "use the image"):
   apply `shared-infra` first, build/push, then apply `hub`.

## Bootstrap sequence

```bash
# 1. Shared infra, once per project.
terraform -chdir=deploy/terraform/configurations/shared-infra init \
  -backend-config="bucket=<project>-<prefix>-tfstate" \
  -backend-config="prefix=<prefix>/shared"
terraform -chdir=deploy/terraform/configurations/shared-infra apply \
  -var-file=terraform.tfvars

# 2. Build and push hub_image using the repo shared-infra just created
#    (out of scope for this Terraform — see the image pipeline).

# 3. One hub.
terraform -chdir=deploy/terraform/configurations/hub init \
  -backend-config="bucket=<project>-<prefix>-tfstate" \
  -backend-config="prefix=<prefix>/hubs/<hub_name>"
terraform -chdir=deploy/terraform/configurations/hub apply \
  -var hub_name=<hub_name> -var state_prefix=<prefix>/hubs/<hub_name> \
  -var-file=<hub_name>.tfvars
```

`state_prefix` must always be passed and must equal the `-backend-config
prefix` used at `init` — Terraform cannot read its own backend config back,
so this is enforced by a `hub_name` variable `validation` block in
`configurations/hub` (not a `check` block: a `check` only warns, which would
still let the apply proceed onto the wrong hub's state). Getting it wrong
fails the plan loudly instead of silently applying one hub's variables onto
another hub's state.

Each further hub is just step 3 again with a new `hub_name`/prefix — the
shared layer is untouched.

## Everything is prefixed; nothing is adopted

Every resource name derives from `name_prefix` (shared layer, default
`tfha`) or `hub_name` (hub layer). There are no unprefixed defaults, no
`import` blocks, and no create-if-missing logic: a name collision fails the
apply, which is the desired behavior on a project that also runs live
Scion infra (`ptone-emblem`: `scion-hub`, `scion-hub-iap-proxy`,
`scion-a2a-bridge`, `scion-discord`, `scion-hub-runner`, `scion-hub-gke`).
All IAM grants are additive (`google_*_iam_member` only — never
`_iam_binding`/`_iam_policy`).

## Shared-infra trust domain and sizing

Hubs sharing one project's infra form one trust domain, not a hard
multi-tenancy boundary — see the design doc §3.7 for the full list of what
is and isn't isolated. In particular, size Cloud SQL's `max_connections`
for the sum across hubs: with `max_open_conns = 10` per hub instance and
`max_instances = 3`, each hub can use up to 30 connections, so the default
`max_connections = 200` supports roughly 5 dev hubs with headroom.

## GKE deletion protection is Terraform-only

Unlike Cloud SQL (`deletion_protection` + `settings.deletion_protection_enabled`)
and Filestore (`deletion_protection_enabled` + `deletion_protection_reason`),
`google_container_cluster` has no separate API-level deletion-protection
field — only the one Terraform-level `deletion_protection` attribute, which
blocks `apply`/`destroy` from replacing or deleting the cluster while true.
There is no equivalent GCP API guard for the GKE cluster the way there is
for SQL/Filestore.

## Destroy runbook

**Order: every hub root first, then shared.** Never the reverse. This is
enforced by several complementary, deliberately redundant layers (design
§3.10) — `terraform destroy` skips lifecycle preconditions entirely (see
"Why the interlock alone isn't enough" below), so no single one of these is
sufficient on its own:

> **Prohibited, always, without exception (verbatim from the design):**
> - Never run `terraform destroy -var deletion_protection=false` against
>   `shared-infra` outside step 2 below.
> - Never use `-target` together with `deletion_protection` on
>   `shared-infra`.
>
> Both turn the API-level protection flags off on `tfha-pg`/`tfha-nfs` while
> hubs may still be present, without ever evaluating `destroy_guard` (a
> `-target` apply skips it because it isn't targeted; a plain `destroy`
> skips it because Terraform doesn't evaluate preconditions on resources
> being destroyed). Doing either is two deliberate deviations from this
> runbook, not an accident — see the residual-risk note below.

1. For each hub: empty its artifacts bucket, **noncurrent versions
   included** — the bucket is versioned and deliberately has no
   `force_destroy`, so `destroy` fails otherwise:
   ```bash
   gcloud storage rm -r --all-versions gs://<project>-<hub>-artifacts/**
   ```
   Then `terraform -chdir=configurations/hub destroy` (with that hub's
   backend prefix and tfvars). This removes only that hub's resources; it
   never touches shared infra, because the hub root only reads shared infra
   via data sources.
2. `terraform -chdir=configurations/shared-infra apply -var
   deletion_protection=false ...`. The `terraform_data.destroy_guard`
   precondition makes this specific apply **fail** while any hub database
   still exists on the shared Cloud SQL instance — every hub creates exactly
   one, so this is the proxy for "a hub still exists".
3. On a teardown branch (never merged to `main`), commit removing
   `lifecycle { prevent_destroy = true }` from the three shared stateful
   modules (`cloudsql-instance`, `filestore`, `gke-autopilot`). This is a
   literal in each module, not a variable — Terraform doesn't allow a
   variable-driven `prevent_destroy` — so intentional teardown costs a
   one-line commit per module. That friction is intended for infra every
   hub depends on.
4. `terraform -chdir=configurations/shared-infra destroy`, from that branch.
5. The operator (vm-deploy) compares a before/after `tfha*` resource
   inventory to confirm nothing outside the prefix was touched, and that
   nothing was left behind.

**Why the interlock alone isn't enough, and why step 3 exists.** Guardrail
2 above (`destroy_guard`) only protects the *state transition* from
protected to unprotected — but `terraform destroy` never evaluates lifecycle
preconditions on the resources it's destroying, `destroy_guard` included. A
direct `terraform destroy -var deletion_protection=false` against
`shared-infra` walks straight past it. What's left at that point: the
API-level flags refuse `tfha-pg` and `tfha-nfs`, and the provider refuses
`tfha-agents` by reading `deletion_protection` from state — but **nothing
stops the Artifact Registry repo, the subnet, the PSA address, or the
service-networking connection**, none of which carry any protection. The
result is a *partial* destroy: the data resources survive, orphaned from
their own network, with Terraform state disagreeing with reality — worse
than a clean loss, because the natural recovery (re-apply) is exactly where
an accidental adopt-then-destroy of live resources happens. `prevent_destroy`
(step 3) closes this: it fails at **plan** time, before anything is applied,
so a full (or `-target`) destroy of protected plumbing aborts entirely
instead of partially succeeding.

**Residual, not closed:** `apply -target=module.<x> -var
deletion_protection=false` skips `destroy_guard` (it isn't targeted) and is
an in-place *update*, which `prevent_destroy` doesn't cover — it can turn
the API flags off on live shared resources with hubs still present, after
which an out-of-band `gcloud … delete` would succeed. This needs two
deliberate deviations from this runbook to reach; it is prohibited above,
not enforced in config. GKE deletion protection is also Terraform-only (see
"GKE deletion protection is Terraform-only" above) — an operator with
`container.clusters.delete` (which vm-deploy's
operator SA has today) can delete `tfha-agents` out-of-band regardless of
any of this. Both are recorded as residual risk in the design doc §9, not
omissions.

## Troubleshooting

**A 403 on a secret named `scion-hub-<h12>-...` shortly after the first
`hub` apply** means IAM propagation, not a wrong condition: the hub SA's
conditioned `secretmanager.admin` grant (hub-identity) can take longer than
the built-in 120s guard (`time_sleep.hub_iam_propagation`) to become
consistent. **Re-apply** — do not widen the IAM condition to work around it.
Widening it is exactly the mistake this whole scoping exercise exists to
prevent (see hub-identity's IAM scope rule comment).

## What's not here yet (see design §7)

- Phase 2: a second hub, Cloud SQL `REGIONAL` + backups, `min_instances = 2`
  (pending an HA broker confirmation), `check` blocks asserting the
  deterministic URL/audience, bucket lifecycle.
- Phase 3: `shared_overrides` for hand-built infra, resolving OQ-7 (user-
  and project-scope secrets have no per-hub prefix to condition on — see
  hub-identity), moving the DB DSN to a secret env ref, per-module READMEs
  (terraform-docs), typed `validation` blocks on every remaining variable.
- Phase 4: this README grows prereq/rollout detail, CI (`fmt`/`validate`/
  `tflint`), and a link from `docs-site/.../hosted/ha/setup-gcp.md`.
