# --- Destroy guardrail (design §3.10 item 4) ---
#
# GCP does not refuse to delete a Cloud SQL instance that still has hub
# databases on it (nor a Filestore instance with active clients, nor a GKE
# cluster with namespaces) — so the guardrail has to live here, not rely on
# the API to say no. To tear this stack down you must first apply with
# deletion_protection=false, and that apply fails while any hub database
# still exists on the shared instance. The protection-off state is therefore
# unreachable while hubs are present, which makes the subsequent `destroy`
# safe. A hub's database is the proxy for the whole hub: every hub root
# creates exactly one (cloudsql-database), and never manages the instance
# itself (reviewer check: google_sql_database_instance appears only in
# modules/cloudsql-instance).
#
# Required shape (corrected by tf-review, reproduced offline on TF 1.9.8,
# and confirmed live against ptone-emblem by vm-deploy — including a false
# alarm on this exact block from a stale checkout, retracted once vm-deploy
# re-ran against the actual commit: 23-resource plan, exit 0, no 403):
# evaluated at PLAN, with NO module dependency, tolerant of the instance not
# existing yet. `instance = module.cloudsql_instance.instance_name` looks
# more correct (a resource reference instead of a literal), but it is
# exactly the bug: it defers this read to APPLY time, ordered *after* the
# instance update. On `apply -var deletion_protection=false` with hubs still
# present, `settings.deletion_protection_enabled` would flip off *before*
# the precondition below fails — precisely the state transition this guard
# exists to prevent. The literal name plus an existence check first is not a
# style choice; do not "fix" it back to a module reference.
#
# An intent-based alternative (`count = var.deletion_protection ? 0 : 1`,
# skipping the existence probe) was considered and rejected: this
# existence-based shape keys the guard on whether the instance is actually
# there, so it stays live and accurate during normal operation rather than
# only when someone is already trying to turn protection off.
