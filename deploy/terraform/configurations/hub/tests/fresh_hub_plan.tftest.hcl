# Regression coverage: prove configurations/hub composes and plans end to
# end, fully offline, for a brand-new hub with NOTHING pre-existing — no
# shared infra, no prior state, no Secret Manager secret already holding a
# version. mock_provider replaces every provider this root and its module
# tree use (google, google-beta, kubernetes, random, time) with a
# schema-driven fake that never calls a real API, so there is no GCP project,
# no credentials, and no registry access needed to run this file.
#
# This guards against a real defect: a fresh hub's first plan used to read
# `data.google_secret_manager_secret_version.db_password` for a secret that
# only gets a version once `cloudsql-database` has actually created it. That
# data source's read happens at plan time, so on any hub that has never been
# applied before, the real Secret Manager API 404s ("not found or has no
# versions") before the secret ever exists — no fresh hub could plan.
#
# What this test does NOT prove (say so, don't fake it): Terraform's mock
# providers do not reproduce that failure mode — a mocked data source always
# synthesizes a schema-shaped value and succeeds, regardless of whether the
# "real" resource it names would exist. Re-adding a plan-time data source
# read of a not-yet-created secret would still pass this test unchanged,
# because the mock has no concept of "not found". This test can only prove
# the fixed configuration composes and plans cleanly under a fresh, fully
# mocked environment; the actual guarantee that the hazard is gone is
# structural — hub-cloudrun/main.tf no longer contains
# data.google_secret_manager_secret_version.db_password at all (var.db_password
# is a plain sensitive module input now — see that variable's description).

# The database DSN (including the password) is passed to the hub as a

# settings contain no "postgres://" and the service has that secret env,
# but that can't be done here: a `run` block's `module.<name>` reference
# only exposes that module's declared *outputs* (service_uri, iap_audience,
# bucket_name — none of which carry this data), never its internal
# resources' attributes, even under `command = plan`. Tried directly against
# `module.hub_cloudrun.google_secret_manager_secret_version.settings
# .secret_data` and `module.hub_cloudrun.google_cloud_run_v2_service.hub
# .template[0].containers[0].env` — both fail with "Unsupported attribute".
# Adding new hub-cloudrun/hub-root outputs purely so this test file can read
# them is declined as a production surface change for comparatively little
# gain, since the two facts this would assert are already directly visible
# by reading the diff: settings.yaml.tftpl's server.database block has no
# `url:` key any more (see that file), and google_cloud_run_v2_service.hub
# declares the SCION_SERVER_DATABASE_URL env block explicitly
# (hub-cloudrun/main.tf). The actual end-to-end proof that this matters —
# the hub's real config loader takes database.url from this env var when the
# file has none — needs a Go-level test against the real loader, which mock
# Terraform providers can't reach anyway (see this file's header on what
# mock_provider can't reproduce).
