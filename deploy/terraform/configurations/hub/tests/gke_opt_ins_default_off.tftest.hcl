# configurations/hub must plan exactly as before the hub-gke opt-ins were
# added to its modules: hub-identity's hub_workload_identity_ksa (default
# null) and agent-runtime-k8s's create_hub_rbac (default true).
#
# configurations/hub passes neither argument, so each run below calls one of
# those modules with exactly the arguments configurations/hub's main.tf
# passes and nothing more, and asserts the defaults keep today's resources:
# the hub Role/RoleBinding with both subjects, no hub Workload Identity grant,
# and the same 7 hub IAM grant handles hub-cloudrun's boot_prerequisites
# keys on. (A root test cannot read resources inside child modules, and
# adding outputs to configurations/hub would itself change every hub's plan,
# so the modules are exercised directly.)
#
# Not provable under mock providers: that an EXISTING state keeps its RBAC
# objects. count moved kubernetes_role.hub / kubernetes_role_binding.hub to
# [0], and agent-runtime-k8s carries moved blocks for both, so applied state
# is re-addressed rather than destroyed. When this change was made, the
# verbose plan of fresh_hub_plan.tftest.hcl was diffed before and after: 47
# planned objects both times, and the only difference was those two
# addresses gaining [0].
