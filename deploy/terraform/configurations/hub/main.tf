  # Real resource attributes only, never a module reference or a

  # propagate before the first revision boots. A module-level depends_on used
  # to express this instead, and that broke the settings secret on every
  # unrelated change to these three modules: a depends_on on the whole module
  # block defers every resource AND data source inside it, so an IAM-only
  # change under agent-runtime-k8s, cloudsql-database or hub-identity made
  # the settings secret's secret_data look unknown at plan time and forced a
  # spurious replace of the settings secret version (observed on a real
  # apply: an IAM-only change came out as 2 add / 0 change / 1 destroy
  # instead of 2/0/0). db_name/db_user (referenced directly in this map) and
  # hub_iam_grants (passed as a module argument above) already create real
  # dependency edges on their own (they're resource attributes, not just
  # variables) — bundled here too so all of the ordering requirements are
  # visible in one place, not split between incidental variable wiring and
  # this map. db_name/db_user are no longer separately passed to hub-cloudrun
  # as module arguments (the DSN is built entirely inside cloudsql-database
  # now — see hub-cloudrun's variables.tf); they still appear here purely for
  # this ordering edge, sourced straight from cloudsql-database's outputs.
  # The one requirement that had NO other edge at all was the nfs-init Job:
  # nfs_export (above) is a plain path string, known before the Job ever
  # runs, so nfs_init_job_id (a real attribute of the Job resource) is what
  # actually closes that gap. It is the Job's .id ("<namespace>/<name>"), not
  # its .metadata[0].uid: the provider sets .id from the create response
  # before wait_for_completion runs, but leaves uid null in state until the
  # next refresh, so keying on uid made this terraform_data show a spurious
  # 0/1/0 on every fresh hub's second plan even though the graph edge (and so
  # the ordering) was never actually broken.
