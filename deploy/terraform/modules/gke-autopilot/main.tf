  # needs this guard: without it, nothing in Terraform stops a direct
  # `terraform destroy -var deletion_protection=false`. Real protection
  # against an out-of-band `gcloud container clusters delete` needs an IAM
  # deny / org policy outside Terraform (ptone's call; residual risk, design
  # §3.10/§9). Teardown needs a one-line commit removing this on a
  # never-merged teardown branch (design §3.10 guardrails 5-8, Alt-N).
