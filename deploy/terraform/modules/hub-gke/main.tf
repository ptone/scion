#   2. the front door reads the NEGs (via the neg_name output, unknown until
#      the Service exists)
#   3. the front door's backend service -> iap_audience
#   4. helm_release.hub (this module), which needs iap_audience

# (which itself needs the front door's iap_audience). It selects the chart's
# pods by the chart's selector labels. ClusterIP is all a standalone NEG
# needs. The NEG controller adds a cloud.google.com/neg-status annotation
# back onto this Service; the root's kubernetes provider ignores it.
#
# "zones" pre-provisions a NEG in every listed zone, with or without nodes
# there. Without it the controller creates NEGs only in zones that have
# nodes, and the front door's per-zone NEG reads fail for the others. Needs
# GKE 1.36.2-gke.3104000 or later (the calling configuration checks); a
# malformed value makes the controller silently fall back to nodes-only
# zones, with only a Warning event on this Service.
