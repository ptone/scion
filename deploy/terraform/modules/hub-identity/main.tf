# --- Hub SA: project-level grants ---
#
# IAM scope rule: a separate rule from the "additive grants only" rule above
# governs what a grant *hands out*, not just how it's expressed. No
# project-wide grant may reach resources outside this hub's own names. A
# shared project can hold many hubs' Secret Manager secrets and IAP
# resources, including other live hubs' user_signing_key/agent_signing_key —
# a project-wide roles/secretmanager.admin would let this hub's SA read and
# delete them.
#
# Replaced by:
#  (a) per-secret secretAccessor on this hub's own Terraform-managed secrets
#      — <hub>-settings/-session-secret/-kubeconfig (hub-cloudrun) and
#      <hub>-db-password (cloudsql-database), not here;
#  (b) hub_secretmanager_admin_hub_prefixed below, a conditioned grant scoped
#      to exactly the resource-name prefix this hub's own secrets fall under
#      — never another hub's or the live stack's. It covers every scope —
#      hub, user, and project alike — under the hub-prefixed Secret Manager
#      naming from ptone/scion#2152: scion-<sha256(hub_name)[:12]>-*, hashing
#      hub_name alone rather than hub_name:scopeID.
#
#      Whether an IAM condition on a resource-name prefix covers
#      `secrets.create` (not just operations on an existing secret) was
#      verified empirically against the live API: it does, so no
#      pre-create fallback is needed.
#
# Exception, operator-chosen: hub_sa_minting (below), off by default. When
# enabled it grants project-wide roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin, which reaches
# every service account in the project. GCP cannot scope it to this hub's
# names: iam.serviceAccounts.create is evaluated on the project, and
# SA-resource conditions see the unique ID, not the account name. It is
# documented as project-wide and meant only for a project dedicated to
# this hub.
#
# project_number (below) always comes from the shared-lookup data source via
# var.project_number, never a literal — a hardcoded project number in this
# expression would silently stop matching if this Terraform were ever
# pointed at a different project.

# rule above, and off by default. No condition block, so toggling it is a

# --- Transport SA ---
#
# NOT granted here: a project-wide roles/iap.httpsResourceAccessor, since
# it reaches every IAP-protected resource in the project, including any other
# live hub. Scoped instead to just this hub's own
# Cloud Run service, in hub-cloudrun's google_iap_web_cloud_run_service_iam_member
# (the same resource type already used there for human iap_members).

# --- Agent SA ---
#
# No Secret Manager role at all. The agent
# SA is the Workload Identity binding for agent pods, which run agent- and
# user-supplied code: a project-wide accessor would let any agent pod read
# scion-<hash>-user_signing_key/-agent_signing_key for the live hub (or any
# other hub sharing this project) and mint valid tokens for it — escalation
# from "runs an agent" to "administers an unrelated production hub", and
# unfixable with an IAM condition (user/project-scope secret names have no
# per-hub prefix — same root cause as the hub SA note above). The
# rendered settings' runtimes.remote.gke is therefore set to false: with
# gke: false, k8s_runtime.go puts resolved secrets into namespaced
# Kubernetes Secrets the hub writes, not a SecretProviderClass the agent
# pod's own WI identity reads — so Secret Manager access is never in the
# agent's reach at all, by construction, not just by omitted IAM. The agent
# SA keeps only its Workload Identity binding (agent-runtime-k8s), plus the
# project-level model-access role(s) below.
#
# The WI binding lets an agent authenticate AS this SA, but authentication
# isn't authorization — with no model-access role, Vertex calls 403.
# var.agent_sa_project_roles defaults to exactly roles/aiplatform.user, the
# minimum needed to call Vertex, validated against owner/editor/*.admin for
# the same reason the hub SA note above rejects a project-wide grant: this
# runs agent- and user-supplied code.
