Deliberately .id (list(string)), not the whole resource objects: google_project_iam_member and google_service_account_iam_member have different attribute shapes (e.g. project vs. service_account_id), so a list(any) of the full objects fails type unification at the consuming module's typed variable boundary with \"all list elements must have the same type\" — reproduced credential-free with two different hashicorp/random resource types before fixing (tf-review). .id still carries the same dependency edge as the full object would."
