# after its IAM would crash-loop with 403s on the very first apply. This is
# purely a timer: it depends on every hub-SA IAM grant (hub-identity), waits,
# and the Cloud Run service below depends on it. triggers include the
# condition expression, so the sleep re-arms if that condition is ever
# changed (e.g. a different hub) — a create-only sleep would protect only
# the first apply and silently stop protecting a later condition change.
# See the README troubleshooting note: a 403 on scion-hub-<h12>-... shortly
# after a first apply is IAM propagation. Re-apply. Do NOT widen the
# condition to work around it.
# F-106 (design §9): the caller used to express this module's ordering
# requirements (agent-runtime-k8s's nfs-init Job, cloudsql-database's DB/
# user, hub-identity's IAM grants) as a module-level depends_on on the
# `module "hub_cloudrun"` block itself. A module-level depends_on defers
# EVERY resource and data source inside the module — including
# data.google_secret_manager_secret_version.db_password above, which has no
# actual ordering need on those modules — whenever anything in them has a
# pending change. That made db_password's secret_data unknown at plan time,
# which made settings' secret_data (which embeds it) unknown too, forcing a
# spurious replace of the settings secret version on every unrelated change
# to those three modules (vm-deploy caught this on a real apply: a plan that
# should have been a pure IAM-member add came out 2 add / 0 change / 1
# destroy). terraform_data.boot_prerequisites below is the replacement:
# var.boot_prerequisites carries only real resource attributes (never a
# module reference), so only the one resource that actually needs to
# wait — the Cloud Run service, via its own depends_on below — is affected.
