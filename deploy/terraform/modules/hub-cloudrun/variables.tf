# requires each variable's OWN validation condition to reference var.<self>
# directly (a static check, not just "produces a correct boolean") — so this
# local only covers the part that's genuinely shared (var.timeout's own
# format), and each variable's second validation block below still
# references itself directly via a ternary, not indirection through a local
# for its own value.
#
# Ternary, not `&&`, for the ACTUAL bound check (design note, found the hard
# way while writing this): HCL's `&&` short-circuits for its BOOLEAN RESULT,
# but does NOT stop a later operand's function-call ERROR just because an
# earlier operand is false — confirmed offline: `can(regex(...)) &&
# tonumber(bad_string)` still crashes plan with a raw "cannot convert ... to
# number" error, even though the left side is false. Only a genuine
# conditional (`cond ? a : b`) skips evaluating the untaken branch entirely,
# which is what actually avoids calling tonumber()/trimsuffix() on a value
# that failed the format check.
