  # entirely (confirmed by vm-deploy against the live API), so a direct
  # `terraform destroy -var deletion_protection=false` on the shared root
  # would otherwise partially succeed here. This guards the *operation*:
  # any plan that would destroy this resource errors before anything is
  # applied. Intentional teardown needs a one-line commit removing this on a
  # teardown branch that is never merged (design §3.10 guardrails 5-8, Alt-N).
