# The hub/shared layer contract (design §3.4, §3.5, Alt-K). This module
# resolves shared infra purely by naming convention through data sources —
# never through terraform_remote_state — so the hub root works against any
# conforming infra, including hand-built infra, and fails loudly (not
# silently) if a resource is missing. No adoption: this module only reads.

# Added for image_registry (design §3.4/§3.6, found before the tfha-h1
# apply): without a top-level image_registry in settings.yaml, the hub never
# rewrites bare harness images (scion-claude:latest etc.) to the shared AR
# repo, GKE pulls them from Docker Hub where they don't exist, and phase 1
# check 3 (agent pod) fails with ImagePullBackOff.
