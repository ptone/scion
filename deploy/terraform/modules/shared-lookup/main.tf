# The hub/shared layer contract (design §3.4, §3.5, Alt-K). This module
# resolves shared infra purely by naming convention through data sources —
# never through terraform_remote_state — so the hub root works against any
# conforming infra, including hand-built infra, and fails loudly (not
# silently) if a resource is missing. No adoption: this module only reads.
