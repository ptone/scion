# Cloud Monitoring Configuration

Alert policy definitions and uptime check configurations for Google Cloud
Monitoring. These YAML files document the monitoring rules for the Scion hosted
platform and can be applied using any of the supported provisioning tools.

## Applying the configuration

> **Important:** The YAML files in this directory use a custom DSL for
> readability — they do **not** conform to the raw GCP API schemas. You cannot
> pass them directly to `gcloud` commands. Use Terraform or Pulumi (below)
> which consume these files as configuration inputs, or manually translate
> each entry into a GCP-native AlertPolicy / UptimeCheckConfig / NotificationChannel
> JSON document before using the `gcloud` CLI.

### gcloud CLI (manual conversion required)

```bash
# The YAML files must be converted to GCP-native API format first.
# For each alert policy entry in alert-policies.yaml, create a separate
# GCP AlertPolicy JSON/YAML document, then apply:
#
#   gcloud alpha monitoring policies create --policy-from-file=<converted-policy>.json
#
# Notification channels and uptime checks require the same conversion:
#   gcloud beta monitoring channels create --channel-content-from-file=<converted-channel>.json
#   gcloud monitoring uptime create --config-from-file=<converted-check>.json
```

### Terraform

Use the `google_monitoring_alert_policy`, `google_monitoring_uptime_check_config`,
and `google_monitoring_notification_channel` resources. The YAML files in this
directory serve as the source of truth for threshold values, durations, and
display names.

### Pulumi

Use the `gcp.monitoring.AlertPolicy`, `gcp.monitoring.UptimeCheckConfig`, and
`gcp.monitoring.NotificationChannel` resources with values from these files.

## Hub dashboard

`dashboards/scion-hub.json` is a native Cloud Monitoring dashboard (unlike the
YAML files above, it needs no conversion). It charts the Hub's DB pool,
dispatch, notification and launch reaper metrics, with one line per Hub
replica (`service_instance_id`) and a filter for the Hub deployment
(`scion_hub_id`). It contains no project ID:

```bash
gcloud monitoring dashboards create --project=PROJECT_ID \
  --config-from-file=deploy/monitoring/dashboards/scion-hub.json
```

The Hub exports these metrics as `workload.googleapis.com/scion.*`.
`pkg/observability/hubmetrics/dashboard_test.go` checks that every chart
queries a metric the Hub exports. See the docs page *Hub Monitoring Dashboard*
for details.

## Prerequisites

1. Notification channels must be created before alert policies that reference
   them. See `notification-channels.yaml`.
2. The metrics must be exported before alert policies can evaluate. The Hub
   exports them through the Google Cloud metric exporter as
   `workload.googleapis.com/scion.*` (see above);
   `pkg/observability/hubmetrics/alert_policies_test.go` checks every policy
   metric type against the metrics the Hub defines.
3. The GCP project must have the Cloud Monitoring API enabled.

## File inventory

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `alert-policies.yaml` | 15 alert policies covering DB health, dispatch health, telemetry pipeline, and Hub auth |
| `uptime-checks.yaml` | 4 uptime checks for Hub and Broker health/readiness endpoints |
| `notification-channels.yaml` | 3 notification channel definitions (email, Slack, PagerDuty) |
| `dashboards/scion-hub.json` | Importable Cloud Monitoring dashboard for Hub metrics, per Hub replica |
