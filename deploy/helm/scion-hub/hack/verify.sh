# Static verification for the scion-hub chart.

#   hack/verify.sh --update   regenerate the golden files, then check
#
# What this can and cannot tell you: everything here is a render. There is no
# cluster, so nothing below says the hub works. It says the manifests are well
# formed, that they say what we intend them to say, and - the part that is
# easiest to lose - that the things we intend them NOT to say are still absent.
# The live checks are in VALIDATION.md and have not been run.
#
# Requires: helm, kubeconform, diff. No cluster.
#
# Exit codes. The two failure codes mean different things and need different
# reactions: 1 is "the chart is wrong", 2 is "the checks did not run, and this
# output is not evidence about the chart either way".
#
#   0  every check ran and passed
#   1  the chart failed a check
#   2  META-FAILURE - the run is not evidence: a tool is missing, or the number
#      of assertions executed was not exactly EXPECTED_TOTAL
#
# MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED: before the preflight below existed, running this file
# with no helm on PATH printed FIVE PASSING ASSERTIONS - among them "emits no
# SCION_SERVER_DATABASE_/OIDC_ variable", the single check this phase most
# needs to be true - because each of them greps a rendered manifest for a string
# that must be ABSENT, and every one of those manifests was an empty file. A
# negative assertion against a file that does not exist is the cheapest false
# pass there is, and no amount of care inside the check prevents it.
#
# EVERY grep CALL SITE IN THIS FILE NAMES ITS DIALECT, -E OR -F, AND THAT IS A
# CORRECTNESS PROPERTY RATHER THAN A STYLE ONE. gd-em's ruling (e), as amended by
# gd-trig and the lead: the check is "names its dialect explicitly", NOT "adds
# -E". Adding -E to a pattern written for BRE is a second way to manufacture a
# confident zero - under GNU grep's BRE, \| \? \+ \( are operators and the bare
# forms are literals, and -E swaps both - so the conversion was audited for
# backslash operators (none present). One site did not survive the conversion and
# is documented where it lives: tests/chart-integrity.sh's schema-path arm, where
# '(root)' is a capture group under -E and a literal under -F.
#
# THAT AUDIT IS NOT THE EVIDENCE. The evidence is a differential run of both
# suites, at 36a3fead^ and at 36a3fead, with every grep invocation executed twice
# on byte-identical input - shipped flags, and dialect letter stripped:
#
#   893 invocations each tree · 0 NODIALECT · 0 UNPARSED
#   DIFFERING on (position, exit status, stdout sha256):  0 of 893
#   apparatus control, -F -> -E planted at the leaf filter below:  2 of 893
#
# so the zero is a measurement with a firing instrument behind it rather than an
# absence claim. 58 invocations at 34 distinct sites DO depend on their -E, and
# all 58 are identical between the two trees: every -E that is load-bearing was
# already there, and every -E added was inert on this data.
#
# SCOPE, because the sentence above is about GNU grep and this shell is not the
# only one on the machine: these scripts are #!/usr/bin/env bash and run-all.sh
# invokes them as `bash <script>`. `bash -c 'type grep'` reports /usr/bin/grep;
# the interactive zsh reports a shell function from a Claude Code snapshot which
# injects -G, --ignore-files, --hidden, -I and six --exclude-dir flags into a
# non-GNU engine. None of that reaches this file, and it was measured rather than
# assumed - but do not paste a grep from here into an interactive shell and
# expect the same answer.

# Both chains were run end to end on 2026-08-17 against the binaries at
# /tmp/linux-amd64/helm and /tmp/kubeconform on the authoring box, and the two
# sha256 values above are what they produced.
#
# WHAT THAT SENTENCE MAY NOT SAY, AND ORIGINALLY DID (gd-p1-rev, RQ-2, round 4).
# It said the extracted binaries were `cmp`-identical to "the ones this suite
# uses", and THIS SUITE'S RESOLUTION RULE IS `${KUBECONFORM:-kubeconform}` - a
# PATH lookup. Which bytes this suite uses is therefore a property of the
# reader's environment, and no sentence written in this file can be true about
# it. gd-p1-rev measured the counterexample on the first box that was not mine:
# sha256 225bc03c464df3be, `kubeconform -v` -> `development`, a source build
# rather than the v0.6.7 release tarball. The comment was false there and true
# here, which is the worst available combination, because the honest sha256 row
# printed two lines down then reads as confirming a chain it does not belong to.
#
# SO THE CLAIM IS NOW MADE BY THE RUN INSTEAD OF BY THE COMMENT. The banner
# compares the resolved binary against the pin and prints the verdict. A comment
# asking the reader to believe a chain is a request; a row that recomputes it
# every run is a mechanism.
#
# THIS IS A DISCLOSURE AND NOT A GATE, deliberately. A mismatch prints and the
# run continues at exit 0. Failing on it would convert someone else's toolchain
# into an accusation against the chart - the exact defect the kubeconform
# registry probe below exists to prevent, and the one gd-p1-rev's own extraction
# ran into from the other side when a missing go.mod was reported as a chart
# failure. A reader who wants the same bytes runs the four commands above.

# what belongs under server:. This asserts that the key exists at all, in EVERY
# permutation, and it is here because a Phase 0 guard is closed by it.
#
# --config / -c is reserved in hub.args, and at Phase 0 it was not merely
# reserved, it was LIVE. Not for want of a settings.yaml - the hub seeds one from
# its own embedded defaults on a first boot (cmd/server_foreground.go:104-109 ->
# config.InitMachine, pkg/config/init.go:588-599) and those defaults have no
# server key. THE TRIGGER IS THE KEY, NOT THE FILE, so "the chart mounts a
# settings.yaml" is not the property that matters and a check that asserted the
# mount would not be this check. THIS PHASE MAKES THE FLAG INERT by emitting the
# top-level server key, and the reason is ours end to end:
# loadGlobalConfigFromSettings (pkg/config/hub_config.go:640) reads
# GetGlobalDir() first and unconditionally, and consults the --config path only
# `if !found` (:647-660). `found` is true exactly when
# $HOME/.scion/settings.yaml parses AND has a non-nil top-level `server` key -
# loadServerFromSettingsFile decides it at :1344-1347 on that key alone, not on
# the file existing and not on its contents being useful.
#
# So the flag is inert while, and only while, this chart renders that key. Drop
# it - by minimising the document, by moving the server section under a profile,
# by rendering a settings.yaml that is only profiles and runtimes - and the flag
# is live again, in two forms: the --config path's own settings.yaml becomes the
# sole source of the server config (:648-659), or, failing that,
# loadGlobalConfigLegacy (:635, :699) layers the --config file over the loaded
# configuration (:777-787). Neither is a redirect of the whole load and nothing
# is: GetGlobalDir (pkg/config/paths.go:188-194) takes no arguments.
#
# That is rule 8 from the far side: Phase 0's guard is closed by Phase 1's
# configuration, so it is deferred to whoever changes Phase 1's configuration,
# who has no reason to know they are holding it. This check is how they find
# out. Do not delete it because the top-level shape "obviously" has a server
# key; that obviousness is the entire mechanism.
#
# Under config.existingSecret the property is the operator's, not ours, and
# cannot be checked here - values.yaml says so at config.existingSecret.
#
# WHICH PERMUTATIONS ARE ACTUALLY LOAD-BEARING HERE: minimal and varied. The two
# settings permutations set config.extra.server.log_level, so config.extra merges
# a top-level `server` key back in and they would pass this check even with the
# chart emitting none. Measured, by removing the assertSettings call and renaming
# the emitted key: only minimal and varied went red. Do not "simplify" this loop
# to the settings permutation, and do not add config.extra.server.* to

# and that refusal does not print when acknowledgeHAUnlanded is set. Both of the
# chart's own settings fixtures set it - so the gates are named to every
# operator EXCEPT the two who copied a file out of this repository, which is the
# population most likely to hit them. NOTES.txt prints on every install and is
# the only prose the operator reliably sees.
#
# RENDERING NOTES.txt WITHOUT A CLUSTER. `helm template` evaluates NOTES.txt but

# demand a cluster on this box anyway ("Kubernetes cluster unreachable"), so it
# is not available. The probe therefore copies the chart, RENAMES
# templates/NOTES.txt to a .txt manifest name, and asks helm for that file:
# helm's own file-template renderer runs, on the real bytes, with the real
# values, and the only substitution is the filename. --debug is required because
# the output is prose and not YAML.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
step "the gate list is the same list everywhere it is written"
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A PARITY GUARD OVER A DERIVED LIST. The list itself comes from the walk in
# hack/ha-gates.txt; what this step checks is that the three prose copies agree
# with it and with each other. gd-em ruled the three copies should stay three:
# they are written for three audiences - a numbered table for
# whoever maintains the guard, a single-sentence refusal for whoever tripped it,
# and an operator's table in NOTES - and collapsing them into one shared string
# would make all three read like whichever audience won. What must not differ is
# WHICH GATES, so that is what is checked, in both directions:
#
#   forward   every canonical gate appears in every copy
#   backward  no copy names a preflight key the walk did not find, except the
#             ones this chart already satisfies and the oauth-limb gate, both
#             of which are themselves derived from the walk
#
# The backward half is the one that matters. Without it, adding a gate to
# one copy is invisible: the forward half stays green because the rest are
# still there. An unknown token is a FAILURE and not a warning - the author
# either added a gate and must add it everywhere, or named a key that is not a
# gate and must say so in ALLOWED_NON_GATES below.
#
# The NOTES copy is read out of the RENDER, not out of the template, so a copy
# that is present in the file but conditioned away for this release counts as
# absent - which is exactly what it is to the operator.
#
# WHICH MUTATION REACHES WHICH HALF, MEASURED, because the answer is not the one
# a reader would assume from the assertion names:
#
#   delete a line from the doc table      -> META-FAILURE (one fewer line than the walk found)
#   add a line to the NOTES table         -> META-FAILURE (one more line than the walk found)
#   RENAME a gate in the doc table        -> both parity halves, 2 failures
#   RENAME a gate in the NOTES table      -> both parity halves, 3 with the presence loop
#   add a gate to the refusal string      -> the backward half, 1 failure
#   drop the session gate from the refusal-> the forward half, 1 failure
#
# The two table copies are size-asserted, so pure insertions and deletions are
# caught by the size guard and never reach the parity comparison. That is fine -
# they are caught, loudly, as META-FAILURES - but do not read "the parity check
# catches a deleted gate" out of these assertion names. The parity halves are
# exercised by RENAMES, which is the mutation that keeps the list the right
# length while changing which gates they are, and it is the one a careless edit
# actually produces.

# as a marker rather than pretended into a dotted token. The marker itself is

# fails loudly for a prose gate it has never seen.
# THE `head -1` THAT WAS HERE IS GONE, AND NOT FOR THE REASON IT LOOKS LIKE.
# gd-em's third re-check question: did any single value come off the front of a
# list. This one did. It is NOT a wrapper hazard - the input is a printf over an

# PHASE 2. The hub treats MaxOpenConns <= 1 as UNSET for postgres
# (pkg/config/hub_config.go:573) and substitutes its own default, with a
# documented rationale: a single-connection pool self-deadlocks the moment one
# query waits on another. So an operator who sets 1 to economise on connections
# does not get 1 and does not get an error - they get the hub's default, and
# the settings.yaml they can read says 1. The schema moves that from a silent
# substitution to a refusal at helm template.
#
# THE BOUNDARY IS PINNED FROM BOTH SIDES, which is the only way to check a
# boundary. Rejecting 1 is satisfied by a schema that rejects everything;
# accepting 2 is satisfied by one that accepts everything. Rejecting 0 AND 1
# while accepting 2 locates it exactly, and moving the schema's minimum in

step "every value that only reaches settings.yaml is refused or documented"
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The check on the check for config.existingSecret.
#
# The guard above refuses three named values. A named list answers "are these
# three still refused" and cannot answer the question that matters, which is
# "are these still the only ones". Nothing about a fourth settings value being
# added is visible: it renders, it installs, and the operator's setting is
# discarded with no error - the same silent no-op the guard exists to prevent,
# arriving through the guard's blind spot rather than past it.
#
# So this derives the question from the chart instead of asking it. Every leaf
# of values.yaml is enumerated, mutated one at a time, and rendered twice; a
# value whose mutation moves the settings document and nothing else is a value
# that goes silent under config.existingSecret, and must be either refused by
# the guard or named in the transfer list with the settings key it moved. A
# value in neither place fails here. Nobody has to remember to update a list.
#
# THE ENUMERATION IS THE PART THAT MUST NOT BE HAND-WRITTEN, so it is taken from
# values.yaml at run time by a throwaway chart written into $WORK - Helm walking
# its own values with the same recursion the chart's own helpers use. Two things
# that cost a round to learn and are easy to reintroduce:
#
#   - the walk must be given the same --set values the render gets. Required
#     values with no default (image.repository, hub.hubId, hub.baseUrl) are
#     commented out in values.yaml, so a walk over the file alone does not see
#     them and silently drops three leaves - including the hub ID.
#   - a mutation has to actually mutate. updateStrategy.type reads Recreate at
#     replicaCount 1, so "set it to Recreate" changes nothing and reports the
#     value inert. That class of mistake is caught below by counting the leaves
#     that moved nothing at all rather than by inspection.
#
# Renders here pass --skip-schema-validation. The mutations are deliberately
# odd values and several would be rejected by the schema before a template ever
# saw them; the schema's own rejections are asserted in their own step. What is
# under test here is which document a value reaches, which is a template fact.

#
# WRITTEN IN ITS NARROWED FORM ALREADY, AT PHASE 1, WHERE IT IS VACUOUS. The
# obvious assertion here is that the string initContainers: never appears, and
# that is true today and WILL BE WRONG AT PHASE 2. The Cloud SQL proxy is a
# native sidecar, and a native sidecar is an initContainers entry carrying
# restartPolicy: Always - so the obvious assertion goes red on a change that is
# entirely correct, and the obvious fix is to delete it, which puts the copy
# shape back within reach of a green suite.
#
# So the rule is on the ENTRY, not on the section: every initContainers entry
# must carry restartPolicy: Always. A native sidecar passes; a run-once init
# container does not. Zero entries pass trivially, which is Phase 1's state and
# is exactly why the fixtures below exist - with nothing to scan, the scan proves
# nothing and only the fixtures show the detector still works. Narrow this
# further if a phase needs it. Do not delete it.
# NARROWED AT PHASE 2's REQUEST, BY gd-p2-dev's MEASUREMENT, BEFORE THE PROXY WAS
# WRITTEN. The first version started a new entry on ANY line whose first non-space
# character was a dash. A container's args:, command:, env: and volumeMounts: are
# all block sequences, so every list item inside an entry became its own unnamed
# entry with ok reset to 0 - and the real Cloud SQL proxy, which cannot function
# without args, was flagged as a run-once init container. Correct Phase 2 code,
# red suite, and the cheapest correct-looking fix is to delete the rule.
#
# It also had the dangerous defect in the other direction: with flush-style YAML
# (the dash at the same indent as initContainers:) the first dash was read as the
# END of the block, so a run-once container there was not flagged AT ALL.
#
# So entry boundaries are bound to the FIRST DASH'S INDENT, and name: and
# restartPolicy: are honoured only at the entry's own key indent - a nested
# "env: - name: FOO" cannot supply the container's name, and a nested
# restartPolicy: Always cannot satisfy the rule for the container.

# THE FIXTURES, AND WHAT THEY ARE AND ARE NOT CLAIMS ABOUT.
#
# READ THIS BEFORE ADDING ONE. These are claims about THE PARSER - about how it
# binds entry boundaries, names and restartPolicy to indentation. THEY ARE NOT
# CLAIMS ABOUT THE CLOUD SQL PROXY. Every one of them was typed by hand, and a
# hand-typed fixture is the author's summary of the subject, not the subject.
#
# The first version of this block had three fixtures and the sidecar one was:
#
#     - name: cloudsql-proxy
#       image: proxy
#       restartPolicy: Always
#
# described in the phase notes as standing proof that the rule does not fire on
# the Cloud SQL proxy. It has no args:. It was constructed by asking "what is the
# least YAML that carries restartPolicy: Always?" - that is, FROM THE PREDICATE
# UNDER TEST - and a fixture derived from the predicate can only confirm the
# predicate. The property that makes the real proxy fail was precisely the
# property the simplification omitted, and the suite was green throughout.
#
# So: the fixtures below say the indent binding is correct. The claim "the rule
# does not fire on the Cloud SQL proxy" can only be discharged by a fixture cut
# from an actual `helm template` render of the proxy, and only the phase that
# ships the proxy can produce one. That fixture is owed by Phase 2, with the
# command that produced it named beside it. Until it exists, that claim is
# unmeasured - and the PERMUTATIONS scan below is the standing check that the
# real render stays clean once there is one.

# THE REAL RENDER. Everything above is a fixture I wrote, and a fixture written
# by the author of the predicate can only confirm the predicate - gd-p2-dev's
# rule, filed as theirs. This one is `helm template` output from the Cloud SQL
# phase, pasted verbatim from gd-p2-dev's branch and not retyped from a
# description of it. Produced by:
#
#   helm template t . -f ci/values-minimal.yaml \
#     --set database.driver=postgres --set database.auth=iam --set database.name=scion \
#     --set serviceAccount.gcpServiceAccount=scion-hub@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
#     --set cloudsql.enabled=true \
#     --set cloudsql.instanceConnectionName=my-project:us-central1:scion-db \
#     --set storage.provider=gcs --set storage.bucket=b --set acknowledgeHAUnlanded=true
#
# It cannot be produced on THIS branch, measured: database.auth, database.name
# and the whole cloudsql object are absent from P1's values.schema.json, which is
# additionalProperties: false, so that command here returns "Additional property
# cloudsql is not allowed". That is why it is committed as a captured artifact
# with its producing command rather than regenerated - and why the command is
# recorded, because when the Cloud SQL phase merges this fixture becomes
# reproducible and the comment says how.
#
# It carries the two properties most likely to break an entry-boundary rule and
# both are load-bearing: restartPolicy: Always is the LAST key of the entry, and
# a nested `- ALL` sequence sits between the entry's first dash and it.

step "no assignment in this script can abort it silently under set -e -o pipefail"
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THIS GATE EXISTS BECAUSE THE FIX FOR RQ-2 INTRODUCED RQ-3 (gd-p1-rev, round 5).
# Line 78 is `set -euo pipefail`. Under pipefail an assignment whose pipeline
# fails anywhere takes the whole script out ON THAT LINE, before any reporting
# machinery runs - rc 1, zero bytes on stdout, zero bytes on stderr. Every
# assertion below the abort silently does not happen, and the harness's own
# design goal is that a run which could not execute something SAYS SO and keeps
# going.
#
# Three separate instances of the shape shipped and all three were found by a
# reviewer rather than by this suite: the toolchain banner (:247-248), the golden
# digest binding (:970), and the single-permutation hub_id block (OP-5). In each
# case the hand-written diagnostic for the exact failure it was written for was
# UNREACHABLE. Patching three lines would leave the fourth to be found the same
# way, so this is the class and not the instances.
#
# THE RULE: an assignment from a pipeline must carry `|| true` or its own `||`
# fallback. This is deliberately syntactic. A semantic version would have to
# decide which pipelines "can" fail, and my own record on that question this
# morning is that I cleared :970 in writing on a reason that was false.
# `\+?=` MATCHES APPENDS, AND WITHOUT IT THIS GATE WAS BLIND TO TWO SITES THE
# SAME COMMIT ADDED (gd-p1-rev, round 6). `+` is not in [A-Za-z0-9_], so the name
# class stopped at the `+` and `x+="$(a | b)"` was invisible. The two it could
# not see were verify.sh:2570-2571, added by the notes gate below:
#
#   _ny_settings+="$(settings_block "$WORK/$name.yaml" || true)"$'\n'
#   _ny_kinds+="$(grep -E '^kind:' "$WORK/$name.yaml" || true)"$'\n'
#
# Both happen to carry `|| true`, so the tree was never live-broken. THE GATE WAS
# NOT LYING ABOUT THE TREE, IT WAS LYING ABOUT THE CLASS - which is the only
# thing it exists to do. gd-p1-rev demonstrated rather than argued it: remove the
# one `|| true` from :2570 and nothing else, and since `settings_block` ends in
# `grep -E '^    '` which matches nothing for the existing-secret permutation,
#
#   rc 1, stdout 18698 bytes, stderr 0 bytes, no "assertions:" summary at all,
#   and BOTH assertions below printed `ok` on the way past.
#
# THE GATE CERTIFIED THE SCRIPT AT :2452 AND THE SCRIPT DIED AT :2570, 160 LINES

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
step "nothing points the hub at a second configuration file"
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Everything else in this file asserts what settings.yaml CONTAINS. Nothing so
# far asserts that the hub will read it.
#
# WHAT --config / -c ACTUALLY DOES, WHICH IS NOT WHAT THIS COMMENT USED TO SAY.
# It does not redirect the configuration load unconditionally. LoadGlobalConfig
# (pkg/config/hub_config.go:628) calls loadGlobalConfigFromSettings (:640), which
# reads GetGlobalDir() FIRST and UNCONDITIONALLY and consults configPath only
# `if !found` (:647-660). So the flag's effect depends on whether the global
# read succeeded, and `found` is narrower than "the file exists": it is true
# exactly when $HOME/.scion/settings.yaml parses AND carries a non-nil top-level
# `server` key (loadServerFromSettingsFile, :1331, decided at :1344-1347).
#
# THE FLAG IS INERT BECAUSE OF A PROPERTY OF THIS CHART'S OUTPUT, NOT BECAUSE OF
# ANYTHING IN THE BINARY, AND IT WAS LIVE AT PHASE 0. What was missing there was
# the key, not the file: the hub's own embedded defaults seed a settings.yaml
# with no server section, so `found` was false and configPath was read. Every
# settings-bearing permutation here renders a top-level `server:` key, so `found`
# is true and --config does nothing at all - a property this phase supplies and
# no other phase can.
#
# NOTHING AT ALL, LITERALLY - NOT EVEN A WARNING, and it would be easy to write
# "only warns" here and be wrong in the direction that matters. The flag is not
# marked deprecated: MarkDeprecated appears twice in cmd/server.go, :236 and
# :290, both for --production, never for config or c (the flag itself is
# cmd/server.go:237). The only two warnings in the load path,
# pkg/config/hub_config.go:668 and :678, are about a server.yaml sitting beside
# settings.yaml, and the one that depends on the --config path at all additionally
# requires hasServerYAML(dir) (:1393) - a server.yaml or server.yml next to the
# --config target, which this chart creates nowhere. So an operator who appends
# --config gets no error, no warning and no log line. There is no runtime signal
# to fall back on, which is precisely why a reserved flag is the only available
# guard and why this check is worth its lines.
#
# Render a settings.yaml without the top-level key - a minimisation, a refactor
# of the document's top-level shape, a phase that moves everything under a
# profile - and `found` goes false, the deployment is back in the Phase 0 state,
# and the flag takes effect. IN TWO FORMS, AND
# NEITHER OF THEM IS A REDIRECT OF THE WHOLE LOAD. At :648-659 the --config
# path's own directory is searched for a settings.yaml and, if it has a server
# key, that file becomes the SOLE source of the server config. Failing that,
# LoadGlobalConfig falls through to loadGlobalConfigLegacy(configPath) (:635,
# :699), which loads defaults, then ~/.scion/server.yaml (:772-775), then LAYERS
# the --config file over the result (:777-787) - an overlay. Nothing can move the
# directory the hub reads first: GetGlobalDir (pkg/config/paths.go:188-194) is
# os.UserHomeDir() joined with GlobalDir and takes no arguments. Keep the
# distinction if you narrow this check - an overlay and a redirect have different
# blast radii, and a mitigation scoped to redirection does not cover an overlay.
# The top-level `server:` key is asserted separately, above, for that reason.
#
# Either form, when live, is silent: the mount still exists, the mode is still
# 0444, schema_version is still rendered, every check above still passes, and the
# hub's configuration is coming from somewhere the chart never wrote. That is why
# the check stays even though the flag is currently inert - the condition that
# makes it inert is ours and can be changed by someone who does not know they
# hold it.
#
# This is deliberately NOT the same check as the chart's reserved-flag guard on
# hub.args. That one rejects operator input. This one inspects rendered output,
# and the two fail differently - a guard on the input can be entirely correct
# and still be bypassed by a later phase of this chart rendering the flag
# itself. This check is the one that notices that.
#
# THE DETECTOR IS TESTED AGAINST A FIXTURE, NOT AGAINST THE CHART, AND THAT IS
# DELIBERATE. The obvious way to prove a negative check works is to make the
# thing happen on purpose - append --config through hub.args and watch the check
# fire. That worked while the flag was still appendable, and it stops working the
# moment Phase 0's reserved list claims it: the render then fails at input
# validation, the check never runs, and the test goes green for a reason
# unrelated to what it tests. A test that changes meaning when an unrelated guard
# lands is not a test of this check. So the pattern is proved against fabricated
# args blocks below, which no guard can reach.
#
# THE SHORTHAND TAKES AN ATTACHED VALUE. pflag accepts -cVALUE with no separator
# at all, so -c/etc/x.yaml is a complete flag-and-value in one argv element and
# the earlier pattern - which required = or end-of-element after -c - did not
# match it. That was the one spelling with no fixture, which is the combination
# that reads as coverage.
#
# The `[^-]` branch has no false positives available to it, by construction
# rather than by luck: pflag reads any single-dash element as a cluster of
# shorthands, so -cfg IS -c with the value fg and matching it is correct, not a
# near miss. A double-dash long flag beginning with those letters cannot reach
# that branch at all, because the second character is -, which is what keeps
# --concurrency and --configure-something out.

# an equality is the shape a broken harness produces for free.
#
# settings.yaml is a subPath mount and the kubelet never refreshes one, so the
# chart rolls the pods by digesting the settings document into the pod
# annotation checksum/settings. Phase 2 puts a password inside
# server.database.url in that document. A pod annotation is readable by anyone
# with get on deployments, which is a WIDER audience than the settings Secret's
# own RBAC, and every other component of a DSN - scheme, user, host, port,
# database name - is chart-rendered or public. A digest over that document is
# therefore a digest over a preimage with one unknown in it: an offline oracle
# for the password, checkable by a reader who is not allowed to read the Secret.
#

# discriminator is a control asserting SURVIVAL, never one asserting
# disappearance.
#
# MEASURED ON THIS FILE BEFORE THIS EXISTED, not reasoned about:
#   _ck_digest keyed to a field that does not exist   -> 3 assertions PASS,
#     including "the annotation is not an oracle for it ()", and the run then
#     died at an unrelated -n guard sixty lines later, reporting the CHART as
#     broken ("the digest has become a constant") when the instrument was.
#   _ck_digest killed for the mut-B arm alone         -> rc=0, 297/297,
#     0 failures. A CLEAN PASS with the un-projected control comparing a real
#     digest against an empty string.
#
# So the guard runs THE FUNCTION UNDER SUSPICION over a DERIVED file set and
# demands a well-formed sha256 back. A second awk of my own would not test the
# first one; asserting the shape of what the caller actually consumes does.
# The file set is a glob rather than a list of the six variables the block
# happens to read, because a list goes stale the moment an arm is added and a
# glob cannot - and the expected number is ABSOLUTE, so a file set that grew or
# shrank is a meta-failure naming the number rather than a silently wider sweep.
#
# 🔴 AND IT MUST NOT ABORT, WHICH IS A DIFFERENT FAILURE FROM THE ONE ABOVE AND
# WORSE. This file is line 46 `set -euo pipefail`, so an assignment whose command
# substitution exits non-zero KILLS THE SCRIPT ON THAT LINE - no diagnostic, no
# meta_failure, and the assertion counter never reaches its pin. gd-p1-dev found
# they had cleared a site on the reasoning "empty cannot match, so it fails
# safe", when under `set -e` control never reaches the comparison at all and the
# ${x:-<absent>} they cited was unreachable code.
#
# MEASURED HERE THE WAY THEY PRESCRIBED - delete the input and run it, rather
# than read the code and predict. With the renders removed and no -f guard:
#   rc 2, stdout truncated at the step banner, 0 occurrences of META-FAILURE,
#   0 occurrences of any diagnostic of mine, and on stderr:
#     awk: cannot open .../ck-*.yaml (No such file or directory)
# It "fails closed" only because awk's exit status is 2 and 2 is this harness's
# meta-failure code. THAT IS A COINCIDENCE OF TWO UNRELATED NUMBERS, not a
# guard, and it reports the run as unmeasured while saying nothing about why.
# An unmatched glob is also how it arrives: bash passes the pattern through
# literally, so the file that "cannot open" is a filename nobody wrote.

}

# 🔴 AND _ck_require_live IS NOT ENOUGH, WHICH IS gd-p2-rev's R1 AND IT IS RIGHT.
# It guards the extractor FUNCTION over a file glob; the assertions consume
# VARIABLES populated at separate call sites. THE GUARD AND THE GUARDED WERE IN
# DIFFERENT PLACES, so an extraction written inline at a call site - the same
# defect, one line further down - walks straight past it. gd-p2-rev proved that
# by moving MY OWN PLANT to the call site:
#
#   _mB="$(awk '$1=="checksum/nope:"{print $2}' "$WORK/ck-mut-B.yaml")"
#     -> rc=0, 297/297, 0 failures, and the original signature came back:
#          baseline: '... goes red (3af8bcc3...79 -> a67fb352...78) ...'
#          planted : '... goes red (3af8bcc3...79 -> ) ...'
#   a dead _uB at the URL call site -> rc=0, 297/297, 0 failures.
#   TWO OF TWO CALL-SITE PLANTS ON TWO INDEPENDENT EXTRACTORS, CLEAN FULL PASS.
#
# So the shape check moves ONTO THE OPERANDS, at the point of comparison, where
# it cannot be bypassed by changing how the value was obtained. This is
# gd-p2-rev's prescription, adopted as written and declared as adopted.
# _ck_require_live stays: it catches the function-level case earlier and with a
# better message, and an earlier, more specific diagnostic is worth keeping even
# when a later one would also fire.
#

# THE BANNED READINESS LITERAL, SWEPT OVER THE WHOLE TREE.

# enforced by an author running an ad-hoc grep and reporting a zero - and on
# 2026-08-17 the author of THIS block broke it, in the VALIDATION.md sentence
# asserting the absence, and the ad-hoc zero was three commits stale by then.
# Nothing went red, because nothing was watching. A rule is only in executable
# form for as long as something can execute it.
#
# The literal is assembled from parts so that this file is not itself a hit.
# That is not cleverness for its own sake: hack/ ships in neither the tarball
# nor the render, but it is inside the tree being swept, and a sweep that
# matches its own source is a sweep that can never return zero.
_banned_path="/health""z"
#
# EXPLICIT FILE ARGUMENTS, NEVER -r. Recursion is the one axis on which a grep
# wrapper was measured to silently narrow the file set on this project; an
# explicit path is one the instrument cannot decline to visit. -F because the
# pattern is a literal and -F is the only flag that cannot reinterpret it.
# /usr/bin/grep BY FULL PATH, and no -z/-Z/--null anywhere in this block. Both
# matter and neither is style. The stock binary sees binary files; the shell
# function that shadows `grep` in some interactive environments passes -I and
# --exclude-dir=.git, so it would skip a needle sitting in a binary or under
# .git. MEASURED, planted needle in a binary blob: /usr/bin/grep -lF finds it,
# the wrapped form does not. The chart tree holds 0 binaries and 0 .git paths
# today, so this changes no current result - it means the gate keeps working if
# that stops being true. Adding -z or -0 here to "harden" the list would switch
# engines mid-gate, which is the opposite of hardening.
# STDERR IS CAPTURED AND PUBLISHED, NOT SUPPRESSED, AND THE EXIT STATUS IS KEPT.
# The first version of this line was `... 2>/dev/null || true`, and it was
# FAIL-OPEN: grep exits 0 on a match, 1 on none and >=2 on an error, so an
# unreadable file or a too-long argument list produced an empty stdout, a
# discarded status and a discarded diagnostic - indistinguishable, byte for
# byte, from a clean absence. The gate would have printed "appears in 0 of 41
# files" and passed. `0 lines of stderr` is a finding; a suppressed stream is
# not. Both sweeps below append here and both statuses are asserted afterwards.
# Both call sites redirect to a FILE rather than into $(...) or < <(...), and
# that is required, not tidiness. MEASURED: with the tree sweep behind a process
# substitution, mapfile returned before the subshell's status append landed, and
# the status file held 1 line where 2 invocations had run. Redirecting to a file
# runs the function in THIS shell, so $? is the parent's and there is no write
# to race. The count assertion below is what caught it - it demanded exactly 2
# and got 1 - which is the whole argument for pinning an absolute count instead
# of checking that the statuses seen so far look acceptable.

# THE CORPUS, CLEARED ON EVERY KNOWN NARROWING AXIS AT EVERY DEPTH. A
# .gitignore three directories down narrows a search rooted above it, so the
# required form is a find at all depths, never a look at the root. Measured
# 2026-08-17 over this chart:
#   total files, all depths            41
#   .gitignore  at any depth            0      .ugrep at any depth   0
#   directories named .git              0
# The row that USED to sit here said "non-text files 0 of 41", counted with a
# -Il census, and it is withdrawn rather than corrected: "binary" under the
# wrapper is a verdict on a (file, pattern) PAIR, not on a file, so a census
# taken with one pattern cannot clear a sweep run with another. Measured
# elsewhere in the fleet: a \377\376 file with NO NUL byte is called text by
# one and dropped by the other, in both directions. The right statement is not
# a cleaner census, it is that THIS GATE IS NOT EXPOSED TO THAT FILTER AT ALL -
# it calls /usr/bin/grep, which has no -I unless asked, and stock grep -l does
# report a match inside a high-byte file. The encoding question belongs to the
# wrapped engine and this gate does not use it.
#   .helmignore at any depth            1      (helm-only, not a grep input)
#   positive control -name Chart.yaml   1      FIRES
# None of it can reach this gate anyway - no traversal, stock binary, explicit
# paths - but "cannot reach it" is an argument and the table is a measurement.
# The enumerator itself was checked too: wrapped and stock find return the same
# set in the same order, 8 runs each, one distinct order per arm.
