reintroduced as an override. The point is not hardening in the abstract: the
artifact this project publishes under the name "scion-hub" runs as root, and an
operator who reasons from the artifact name will eventually point the chart at
it. With a loose security context that image runs as root, and once the Filestore

agents running as uid 1000 cannot write - a failure that surfaces days later and
looks like a storage problem. The REFUSAL is present-tense even though that

image fails admission today, share or no share, and says why.

runAsUser and runAsGroup stay configurable because they must be able to match the

The startup budget, asserted as a DURATION rather than as a threshold count.

periodSeconds x failureThreshold is the time the hub gets to become ready before
the kubelet starts killing it. The schema pins each factor separately and cannot
pin the product, so both of these passed with the schema fully active:

  probes.startup.periodSeconds=1   -> 60 x 1s  = 60s, not 300s
  probes.startup.enabled=false     -> no startupProbe at all

Both rendered clean and passed kubeconform -strict, while the schema's own
description stated the safety property as though it were enforced. A guard whose
stated contract is wider than what it enforces is worse than no guard, because it
stops the reader thinking: an operator lowering periodSeconds for faster
readiness detection reads "at least 60", sees failureThreshold: 60 untouched, and
has cut the first-boot budget by 80% with nothing to tell them.

WHY 300 SECONDS. THE HARM HAS TWO HALVES AND ONLY ONE OF THEM IS PRESENT-TENSE ON
THIS CHART. Each is written in its own tense, because an earlier version of this
paragraph gave the Cloud SQL half as the live justification and the round-4
axis-(d) sweep caught it: the number was being defended by a mechanism this chart
never reaches.

  PRESENT TENSE, ON THIS CHART, TODAY - THE ORDERED SEQUENCE. First boot runs a
  sequence of schema and data migration steps before the listener binds, and a
  kill lands BETWEEN two of them. "Partially applied" is not an inference from the
  word migration: CompositeStore.Migrate (pkg/store/entadapter/composite.go:179-227)
  is a null-scope_id backfill, a dedup, entc.AutoMigrate, an allowlist-to-invited
  data migration, a verification-status backfill and a seed, with in-source
  comments at :180-184 and :202-205 stating that the order matters and why. The
  retry then starts from a different state than the attempt before it, and the
  failure stops being reproducible. THIS HALF RUNS ON SQLITE: migrateStore
  (cmd/server_foreground.go:1168-1170) returns s.Migrate(ctx) directly for every
  driver that is not postgres, and this chart's driver IS sqlite - it renders no
  --db, so the default at pkg/config/hub_config.go:540 stands.

  THE CLOUD SQL PHASE, NOT THIS ONE - THE BLOCKING LOCK. pg_advisory_lock is not
  taken here and cannot be. The postgres branch of migrateStore is its only
  caller, pkg/provision/provision.go's Locker is documented as "on SQLite it's a
  no-op (single-writer serializes already)", and composite.go:221-223 says the
  same thing from the other side. When the Cloud SQL values land the lock becomes
  real, the wait becomes unbounded in the way a lock is unbounded, and 300s stops
  being a margin and starts being a bound. RE-DERIVE IT THERE.

  This is the same treatment updateStrategyType gets below, for the same reason: a
  harm that arrives with a later phase is written in that phase's tense, or it is
  read as a present-tense claim and audited as false.

SO WHAT IS THE 300 ITSELF? A MARGIN, NOT A MEASUREMENT, and it says so rather than
being left to look like one. Nothing in this tree derives 300s from a timed SQLite
migration, and on an empty SQLite database the sequence above is fast. The number
is sized for the case the chart is being built toward - a first boot against a
cold Cloud SQL instance, behind that lock - and it costs the SQLite case nothing,
because a healthy hub passes the startup probe on the first or second check and
never approaches the budget. What the guard buys today is that nobody shrinks the
budget quietly while the phases that will need it are still being added.

DISABLING THE STARTUP PROBE IS PERMITTED ONLY WHILE THE LIVENESS PROBE IS OFF,
which is a real distinction and not a loophole. A startup probe's job is to hold
the liveness probe off until the container is up. With liveness disabled - the
default - nothing can kill the pod during the migration; readiness simply stays
false and the pod stays out of the Service, which is correct. With liveness
enabled and no startup probe, the liveness probe begins immediately and kills the
hub mid-migration, which is the exact failure the budget exists to prevent.

First boot runs an ordered sequence of schema and data migration steps before the listener binds (CompositeStore.Migrate), so a pod killed part-way through leaves a partially applied migration and the retry starts from a different state than this attempt did. The 300s itself is a margin rather than a measurement: it is sized for a first boot against Cloud SQL behind the schema-migration advisory lock, which a later phase adds.

{{/*
Deployment update strategy: Recreate at one replica, RollingUpdate above it.

A DEFAULT MAY ENCODE A PREFERENCE; A REFUSAL MUST ENCODE A HARM. This helper is
the record of that distinction, because it briefly got it wrong.

The default is a preference and owes nobody a justification: at one replica
Recreate is the simpler upgrade, and it is what VALIDATION.md scenario 20 is
written against (a short outage, with PTY sessions, port tunnels and in-memory
presence lost). An operator who would rather keep those across an upgrade sets
RollingUpdate and accepts a window with two pods. That is an ordinary Kubernetes
trade and the chart takes no position on it.

There WAS a fail here refusing explicit RollingUpdate at replicaCount 1, added
during round-2 review and removed in round 3. It is worth knowing why, because
the mechanism was sound and only the justification was invented:

  - THE SUBJECT IS WHAT THIS CHART RENDERS, NOT WHAT THE PROJECT IS BUILDING
    TOWARD. Every wrong answer below came from substituting the second for the
    first. What it renders now: an emptyDir at the hub's state directory, a
    read-only settings.yaml projected into it, and no --db on argv. Both volumes
    are pod-local and one of them cannot be written, so REPLICAS STILL SHARE NO
    MUTABLE STATE - which is the property the argument below actually needs.
  - isHADeployment IS TRUE HERE AND WAS FALSE AT PHASE 0, BY TWO INDEPENDENT
    ROUTES. This bullet used to say the chart mounted no volumes and that
    isHADeployment (cmd/server_foreground.go:927) was false at every replica
    count. Both halves were true while the chart rendered no settings file. Now
    a rendered server.database.driver of postgres satisfies the test at :931,
    and server.storage.provider gcs together with server.auth.mode proxy
    satisfies the one at :934. GKE does not set K_SERVICE, but hub.extraEnv can
    and it renders - measured - so that route is reachable from this chart too,
    and assertHAUnlanded transcribes all three rather than two.
    hostedHAGuardsRequired (:921) is therefore satisfied and
    the hosted HA preflight DOES run - which is why this chart renders the five
    Block-1 keys in both auth modes rather than leaving them to the hub.
  - The stated harm - "two hubs writing the same RWX workspace share" - is still
    not a thing this chart can produce, and the reason is now narrower than "no
    volumes". It is that the share itself does not exist: no RWX volume, no
    workspace_storage section, nothing two pods can both write.
  - The replacement harm - "the upgrade transiently enters HA mode" - has to be
    stated more carefully than it was. HA DETECTION is on, at one replica and at
    ten, so "it is off" is no longer the answer. The answer is that entering the
    hub's HA mode costs nothing here, because every consequence of it is about
    shared mutable state and there is none to share. The refusal was wrong for
    the reason above, not for this one.
  - LATER PHASES CHANGE THIS AGAIN, WHICH IS WHY IT IS WRITTEN DOWN RATHER THAN
    LEFT AS AN ABSENCE. Cloud SQL supplies the database URL behind the postgres
    driver this chart already renders; the workspace-share phase lands the RWX
    volume.
    Concurrency correctness becomes a live question at that point, and it is
    answered there by Postgres advisory locks (pg_try_advisory_lock,
    pkg/provision/provision.go:109-116, "for cross-node mutual exclusion", and
    the blocking pg_advisory_lock in migrateStore at
    cmd/server_foreground.go:1168-1200) - by the hub, not by this chart. If a
    refusal is ever warranted here, it will be warranted then, and it will need
    a harm found in that tree.
  - And no third candidate can rescue it, without anyone having to look for
    one. The refusal triggered only when replicaCount <= 1. Any harm from
    CONCURRENCY is strictly worse at two replicas - permanent instead of
    bounded by one startup - and the chart accepts two replicas without a word.
    A refusal whose trigger is "only one replica" cannot be discriminating on
    concurrency, whatever the harm turns out to be.
  - On the one axis where concurrency IS documented to cost something - more
    than one replica breaks the web terminal and exec for (N-1)/N of requests,
    see replicaCount in values.yaml - the refusal was backwards: it forced
    Recreate, which loses every session with certainty.

The shape that found it is still a good heuristic and it is still worth running:
an enum on one field, a minimum on another, and the property about the pair. It
is how probes.startup's budget was found, and that one was real. But the shape
tells you where to LOOK. The harm has to be found in source before anything is
refused, and that is the half all three of us skipped here. Recorded in
verification/p0-product-invariant-sweep.md as a benign shape-match, next to the
instance that was not.

Assert that a flag or variable NAME does not announce credential material.

Call as:
  {{- include "scion-hub.assertNoCredentialName" (dict "name" $n "source" "hub.args flag") }}

THIS IS NOT REDUNDANT WITH THE VALUE CHECK BELOW, and the next person to read
both will suspect that it is. It is not, for one reason: a credential value is
not distinguishable by inspection. --admin-token=hunter2 is caught here and
cannot be caught there, because "hunter2" has no shape - no scheme, no prefix,
nothing to match on. It is an ordinary word. The value axis reads what the value
looks like; the name axis reads what the operator called it, and when the value
is unremarkable the name is the only signal left.

This is not hypothetical. An earlier revision of this guard dropped the name
axis in favour of value shapes, on the reasoning that names are what produce
false positives. That regressed exactly this case, and it did so while looking
like a security improvement. Do not remove either axis.

The rule is position, not substring, and the distinction is the whole reason this
is not a naive contains-check. A credential noun at the END of a flag name says
what the value IS: --admin-token, --api-key, --session-secret, --gh-pat. The same
noun at the START says what the flag is ABOUT, and the value is then a duration,
a count or a project name: --token-ttl, --secret-manager-project. A plural is
also about, not is: --max-tokens is a limit.

So this matches a credential noun only as a whole trailing segment, or as the
entire name. Substring matching was tried first and rejected: it fired on
--max-tokens, --token-ttl and --secret-manager-project, and because hub.args is
append-only with no override, a false positive there is unusable rather than
merely annoying.

THE SEGMENT SEPARATOR IS THE HYPHEN, AND A CALLER WHOSE NAMES USE ANY OTHER
SEPARATOR MUST TRANSLATE BEFORE CALLING. That is argv semantics and it is
deliberate; it is also a trap, because environment variable names separate with
underscores. Passed SESSION_SECRET unchanged, the pattern above matches nothing:
it needs a hyphen or start-of-string before "secret", and "session_secret"
offers neither. The guard would render, appear in the diff, read as applied, and
catch precisely the value it was added for. A reviewer asking "is this guard
correct" finds a correct guard; the question that finds this is "is it reachable
in the state it guards against".

So the underscore check below is not input validation, it is the reachability
check, and it fails loudly rather than letting the caller proceed with an inert
guard. Translate at the call site - "_" to "-" - and call this unchanged. The
alternative, widening the class to (^|[-_]), was rejected: the hyphen rule is
correct for argv, and the caller with the other convention is the one that
should adapt. Do one or the other, never both.

An underscore in a flag name is also a real error on the argv path: no flag on
`server start` uses one, so pflag would reject it and the hub would crash-loop.
Failing here says so at render time.

It renders nothing and fails the render when the value matches. Defined once and
shared, so the places that call it apply the same test rather than each growing
its own near-miss version of it.

WHERE IT IS ACTUALLY CALLED FROM, AND WHERE IT IS NOT. This comment used to say
it covered "every place in this chart that puts an operator-supplied value
somewhere world-readable". That was false when it was written: the only callers
were five sites inside scion-hub.hubArgs, and a whole-render sweep found
fourteen unguarded surfaces across five object kinds. The sentence told the next
author the surface was already covered, which is worse than saying nothing.

What calls it today:
  - scion-hub.hubArgs, on every rendered argument (argv)
  - scion-hub.assertNoCredentialTree, on every leaf of hub.podAnnotations,
    hub.podLabels, hub.nodeSelector, hub.tolerations, hub.affinity,
    hub.resources, service.annotations and serviceAccount.annotations

WHAT IS STILL NOT COVERED, NAMED RATHER THAN IMPLIED: the scalar NAME fields -
nameOverride, fullnameOverride, serviceAccount.name, rbac.agentNamespace,
runtime.namespace and image.tag. A credential placed in any of those renders
today. Some of them are constrained by a grammar in values.schema.json that a
credential provably cannot satisfy, which is a stronger guard than this one
because it cannot drift; the ones that are not so constrained are a live gap.
Do not read the list above as "the surface is covered" - read it as the list it
is, and check it against the render before you trust it.

It inspects the VALUE, not the name of the thing holding it. Name-based checks
miss the case that actually occurs: postgres://scion:hunter2@10.0.0.1/scion
carries a password and contains none of the words a name pattern would look for.
A name-based check is still worth having, but it is a different axis and belongs
with whatever owns the name.

What it catches: credentials in URL userinfo, credentials in a URL query string
under a well-known parameter name, and a handful of well-known credential
prefixes. What it does NOT catch, and cannot: an opaque high-entropy string with
no recognisable shape. There is no reliable way to tell one of those from a
legitimate identifier, and a heuristic that guessed would reject real values with
no override, which for an append-only list is worse than the hole. Do not add an
entropy heuristic here.

THE USERNAME IN THE USERINFO PATTERN IS OPTIONAL, and that is not a typo. An
empty username is the standard form for a Redis URL and is valid for Postgres,
so redis://:hunter2@10.0.0.1:6379 carries a real password. Requiring one
username character missed it - the same class as the DSN case the name axis
cannot see, since the flag holding it can be called anything.

THE PEM ALTERNATIVE IS UNREACHABLE THROUGH hub.args, and live for every other
caller. Every PEM header contains spaces and starts with a dash, so on the argv
path the whitespace guard in scion-hub.hubArgs always rejects it first. Do not
conclude the branch is dead and delete it: it is the branch that catches a
multi-line private key in an environment value, where whitespace is legal, and
its only test coverage chart-wide lives with those callers rather than here. If
you change this alternative, that is the test that will tell you.

The matched value is redacted or truncated in the failure message. A guard whose
error message prints the secret it just caught has moved the secret from argv
into CI logs.

Apply the credential check to every leaf of an operator-supplied subtree.

Call as:
  {{- include "scion-hub.assertNoCredentialTree" (dict "value" .Values.hub.podAnnotations "source" "hub.podAnnotations") }}

WHY THIS EXISTS, AND IT IS NOT A CONVENIENCE WRAPPER. scion-hub.assertNoCredential
was called from five places, all inside scion-hub.hubArgs, while its own comment
claimed it covered "every place in this chart that puts an operator-supplied
value somewhere world-readable". A whole-render sweep found FOURTEEN unguarded
surfaces across five object kinds - not only the pod template, but Service and
ServiceAccount annotations, which an argv-reading instrument cannot see at all
because neither object has an argv. The comment described a policy the code did
not implement, which is worse than no comment: it tells the next author the
surface is already covered.

IT WALKS, RATHER THAN CHECKING toYaml OF THE WHOLE SUBTREE, AND THE DIFFERENCE
IS NOT STYLE. Two of the three axes in scion-hub.assertNoCredential are anchored
- the prefix axis matches on (^|=). Against a toYaml blob the only leaf at the
start of the string is the first one, so "annotations.x: sk-livekey..." would
render clean while the same value as the first key would fail. A guard whose
result depends on map iteration order is worse than a missing guard, because it
passes in testing. Walking to the leaves puts every value at ^ where the axis
expects it.

THE SOURCE STRING IS BUILT UP AS IT DESCENDS, so the failure names the exact key
- "hub.podAnnotations.example.com/dsn" rather than "hub.podAnnotations" - which
matters most on the nested surfaces (tolerations, affinity, resources) where the
operator has no other way to find which leaf tripped it.

IT APPLIES THE VALUE AXIS ONLY, DELIBERATELY. The name axis
(scion-hub.assertNoCredentialName) judges a hyphen-segmented flag name and fails
on any underscore; annotation and label keys are neither, and routing them
through it would reject "app_version: 1.2" as a caller error. Detecting a
credential by the name of the key holding it is also the defect filed as
finding 2. The value axis is the one that catches a DSN whatever the key is
called.

{{/*
Assert that NO operator-supplied value anywhere in .Values is credential
material. Called once at the top of every template that renders an object.

Call as:
  {{- include "scion-hub.assertNoCredentialsInValues" . }}

IT TAKES THE WHOLE OF .Values AND NOT A LIST OF PATHS, AND THAT IS THE ENTIRE
POINT OF IT. Three separate attempts to enumerate this surface came up short in
one morning: a report of three unguarded values paths turned out to be fourteen;
an enumeration of twenty-six refusal sites could not contain a surface that has
no refusal site to enumerate; and a hand-picked subset chosen by "where a
credential is a plausible mistake" would have excluded nameOverride and
fullnameOverride, which are the two widest surfaces in the chart - they place
the operator's string into all five objects it emits.

A shorter list, a longer list and a cleverer list all share the same defect: a
values path added next month is not on any of them. Walking .Values inverts the
default. A new value is covered on the day it is added, and the only way to
escape the check is to add something that is not in .Values at all.

WHY IT DOES NOT CONDITION ON WHETHER THE VALUE REACHES A MANIFEST. Checking
only values that this particular render happens to emit would make coverage
depend on other values - serviceAccount.annotations would be checked when
serviceAccount.create is true and silently skipped when it is false. That is a
guard switched off by a condition, which is the defect class this chart has
spent the most effort on. It also gets the threat model wrong: a values file
carrying a DSN is committed to a repository whether or not the chart renders it.

WHAT IS EXCLUDED, AND IT IS EXCLUDED BY A GRAMMAR RATHER THAN BY OPINION.
Leaves that values.schema.json types as integer or boolean, and the two closed
enums (image.pullPolicy, updateStrategy.type), cannot express a credential at
all - the schema rejects any string before this check runs. That exclusion is
falsifiable and was tested. The two scalars that DO carry a string pattern were
tested the same way and both FAILED the test, so neither is excluded:
serviceAccount.gcpServiceAccount's pattern accepts "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE" as a
local part because an AWS access key ID is [A-Z0-9]+, and hub.hubId's pattern
"^\S(.*\S)?$" accepts a DSN. A grammar is only a guard if it excludes EVERY
credential, not if one credential happens to fail it.

The hub command line.

--hosted and --host 0.0.0.0 are rendered unconditionally and no value can remove
them. Without hosted mode the server applies workstation defaults, derives
auth-enabled from a development flag and forces its bind address to 127.0.0.1,
which behind a load balancer is unreachable and unauthenticated by accident.

--production is deliberately not emitted: it is a deprecated alias of --hosted.

hub.args appends to this list and can never replace it. Two guards apply to
anything appended.

PFLAG IS LAST-WINS, which is the premise the whole reserved list rests on.
Appending a flag the chart already rendered does not conflict, error or warn -
it silently replaces the chart's value. So "the chart renders it" is not
protection; the reserved list is the protection.

THE FLAG SET IS cmd/server.go PLUS cmd/root.go. server start inherits rootCmd's
PERSISTENT flags, so the flags it accepts are not all declared in the file that
declares the command. Two rounds of this list were built from cmd/server.go
alone and both were incomplete in the same direction: --global, --project, -g
and --grove are all inherited, all accepted by server start, and all absent from
cmd/server.go. If you extend this list, enumerate both files.

The RESERVED flags are grouped by WHY they are reserved, in five lists below,
and the grouping is load-bearing rather than tidy. Only one group is verifiable
against the rendered arguments. For the other four, finding no match in the
rendered arguments is the expected steady state and NOT evidence that the entry
is stale - which is exactly the reasoning that would delete them. A flat list
under one comment invites the next maintainer to verify each entry against what
the chart renders, conclude that --config was added in error, and remove it;
that removal would look like tidying and would reopen the largest hole in this
guard. The failure messages differ per group so the reason is visible at the
point it fires, to the person arguing with the guard rather than only to the
person reading this file.

SHORTHANDS MUST BE LISTED BY LETTER. The normalisation below reduces -x and --x
to the same token, so a shorthand is only caught if its letter is on the list.
"c" is on it for --config and "g" for --project; those are the two shorthands
that matter today. Any future flag registered with a *VarP form needs its letter
added here.

CASE IS NORMALISED before the lists are consulted. pflag itself is
case-sensitive, so --CONFIG would not reach the hub as --config; it would be an
unknown flag and the hub would crash-loop. Rejecting it here turns that
crash-loop into a render error, which is the same reasoning as the whitespace
guards below.

The CREDENTIAL check is scion-hub.assertNoCredential, applied to every rendered
argument. It looks at values rather than flag names - see its own comment for
why, and for what it deliberately does not catch. It replaced a substring match
for "secret", "password" and "token" anywhere in the argument, which both missed
the real case (a DSN) and rejected legitimate flags such as --max-tokens with no
way to override; names are handled by the exact-match reserved list instead.

2. NOTHING may pass these. Not the operator, and not a future phase of this
   chart either. Each of them touches how the hub's configuration or its project
   context is selected - and NOT, as this comment claimed for three rounds, by
   redirecting where the configuration is read from.

   THAT HEADER WAS WRONG ABOUT THE MECHANISM FOR EVERY MEMBER OF THIS LIST, and
   "imprecise" would be the wrong word for it: the model it gave the reader was
   false and has to be removed rather than softened. config.GetGlobalDir()
   (pkg/config/paths.go:188-193) is os.UserHomeDir() joined with a constant. IT
   TAKES NO ARGUMENTS. There is no flag input on this command that can move the
   global configuration directory - not --config, not --project, not --profile,
   not --global. Anyone re-deriving this list should start there, because it
   disposes of the whole family in four lines.

   The reservations stand. Each now carries the reason that is actually true of
   it, and the reasons differ, so they are given per entry.

   DO NOT REMOVE THESE BECAUSE THE CHART DOES NOT SET THEM. That is the point of
   them, not evidence that they were added by mistake. There is no legitimate
   reason for this chart to emit any of them, so "nothing in the rendered args
   matches this entry" is the expected steady state forever.

   --config AND -c: READ THIS BEFORE YOU CHANGE OR CHECK IT. It reaches exactly
   one place on this command's path: config.LoadGlobalConfig(serverConfigPath),
   cmd/server_foreground.go:827, via cmd/server.go:237.

   THE STATE OF THIS FLAG, IN THE ONLY FORM THAT STAYS TRUE:

     LIVE   while the GLOBAL settings document has no non-nil top-level server:
            key. That is Phase 0, this commit.
     INERT  from the moment it has one. That is what the configuration phase is
            for.
     RESERVED IN BOTH STATES, which is the whole reason this entry is written as
            a state machine rather than as a description.

   READ THIS PARAGRAPH AND YOU MAY STOP: WHY THE ENTRY DOES NOT DEPEND ON ANY OF
   THE MECHANISM BELOW. Five separate readings of this flag have been asserted
   confidently and wrongly in a single day, and the reservation was correct under
   every one of them, because A RESERVED FLAG REFUSES THE FLAG INSTEAD OF
   REASONING ABOUT ITS EFFECT. Everything after this paragraph is an explanation;
   none of it is load-bearing for the refusal. That is deliberate, and it is the
   answer to the maintainer who audits this list by auditing effects: you will
   keep finding the effect description imperfect, and THE ENTRY DOES NOT REST ON
   THE EFFECT DESCRIPTION. It also covers a moving target - a mitigation scoped to
   "prevent redirection" does not cover an overlay, and one scoped to "prevent an
   overlay" does not cover a sole-source substitution, and this flag does two of
   those three depending on which loader is reached.

   THE TRANSITION IS THE server: KEY. NOT THE EXISTENCE OF A FILE, NOT WHO WROTE
   THE FILE, NOT WHETHER THIS CHART MOUNTS ONE. Three separate corrections
   collapsed into that one sentence and each of them was a confident wrong answer
   first, so the reasons are worth keeping:

     - loadServerFromSettingsFile (pkg/config/hub_config.go:1331-1347) reads the
       file and then tests raw["server"] for present AND NON-NIL. It never asks
       whether the file exists as a separate question, and "server: ~" parses,
       has the key, and is still not found.
     - THE GLOBAL settings.yaml IS THIS CHART'S, AND IT CARRIES A server KEY.
       That is the whole transition, and it is why the flag is inert here rather
       than merely discouraged. The chart mounts an emptyDir at $HOME/.scion and
       lands its rendered settings.yaml into it as a subPath, so the file
       GetGlobalDir() resolves to is the file this chart wrote.
     - THE HUB DOES NOT SEED ONE OVER THE TOP, AND THE REASON IS THE MOUNT. The
       seeding call is guarded at cmd/server_foreground.go:104 by
       os.Stat(globalDir) / os.IsNotExist, so config.InitGlobal (:107) fires only
       when $HOME/.scion is ABSENT. The emptyDir makes the directory exist before
       the process starts, so the guard takes the else branch and the embedded
       defaults in pkg/config/embeds/default_settings.yaml - schema_version,
       active_profile, default_template, default_harness_config, image_registry,
       cli, runtimes, profiles, AND NO server KEY - are never materialised. The
       rendered file is the only settings.yaml in the container.
     - THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH WAS RIGHT FOR A REASON THAT NO LONGER APPLIES, and
       it is kept here because the reasoning is what a later phase needs. At
       phase 0 the chart delivered no ConfigMap and no Secret, the directory did
       not exist, InitGlobal fired, and the seeded file had no server key - so
       the flag was LIVE, by a different route to a different answer. Anything
       that changes what is at $HOME/.scion changes which of these two paragraphs
       applies: mounting a volume with no settings.yaml in it puts the flag back
       to LIVE, and nothing in the render inspects that.

   THREE VALUES, NOT TWO. Reading the flag as binary is what produced two of the
   wrong answers above. In order of evaluation:

     :647  The GLOBAL settings.yaml is read FIRST and unconditionally. A non-nil
           server key here wins and the --config path is NEVER READ. This is the
           Phase 1 state.

     :648-659  ROUTE A - SOLE-SOURCE SUBSTITUTION, and it is NOT an overlay. When
           the global read finds nothing, and --config is set and stat-able, the
           DIRECTORY of the --config path is searched for a settings.yaml, and a
           non-nil server key found there is returned as the server config, built
           from that file ALONE (ConvertV1ServerToGlobalConfig, :1360). This is
           what an operator pointing --config at a directory actually hits, and it
           fires BEFORE the overlay below.

           A detail of route A worth its own sentence, because it is the kind that
           produces an unfalsifiable bug report: IT DOES NOT READ THE FILE THE
           OPERATOR NAMED. :651-656 stats the path and takes filepath.Dir of it
           when it is not a directory, then appends settings.yaml. So
           --config /etc/scion/myserver.yaml reads /etc/scion/settings.yaml, a
           file the operator never mentioned, and ignores the one they did.

     :699, :772-788  ROUTE B - THE OVERLAY, reached only when route A also finds
           nothing. loadGlobalConfigLegacy loads embedded defaults, then the
           global ~/.scion/server.yaml (:773-775), then LAYERS the --config path
           on top (:778-787). Here a directory means server.yaml or server.yml
           (loadServerConfigFile, :1314-1322) while a file is loaded verbatim
           (:785) - so THE SAME FLAG VALUE SELECTS A DIFFERENT FILENAME IN ROUTE A
           THAN IN ROUTE B.

   Bigger than an overlay, smaller than "the whole configuration load moves",
   which is what this comment claimed for three rounds.

   AND IT GOES INERT IN COMPLETE SILENCE, WHICH IS THE REASON A RESERVED FLAG IS
   THE ONLY GUARD AVAILABLE. There is no deprecation warning on --config and no
   log line of any kind. --config is a plain StringVarP at cmd/server.go:237 and
   carries no MarkDeprecated anywhere. Exactly two flags reachable on server start
   do carry one: "production", marked on serverStartCmd itself at cmd/server.go:236,
   and "grove", marked on rootCmd's PERSISTENT flags at cmd/root.go:251 and so
   inherited here. An earlier version of this sentence read "MarkDeprecated on
   server start covers only production (cmd/server.go:236, :290)" and was wrong
   twice in one clause - it missed the inherited --grove, and :290 is that same
   mark on serverInstallCmd, a DIFFERENT COMMAND, offered as though it were a
   second site on this one. Neither error touches the conclusion about --config,
   which is exactly why it survived three readings: A CITATION THAT FAILS IN A
   PLAUSIBLE WAY IS WORSE THAN ONE THAT FAILS OBVIOUSLY. The
   only two warnings anywhere on this path (pkg/config/hub_config.go:668 and
   :678) fire on server.yaml coexisting with settings.yaml and are not about
   --config at all. An earlier version of this comment claimed a deprecation
   warning; it does not exist, and "accepted and silently ignored" is a worse
   defect than "redirects", not a milder one - a redirect is at least detectable
   by its effects.

   THE ONE FEEDBACK PATH THE FLAG CAN PRODUCE IS WORSE THAN SILENCE. Point
   --config at a directory that also holds a server.yaml and :678 prints "Both
   settings.yaml (server key) and server.yaml exist in <their directory>. Using
   settings.yaml." - naming THEIR directory while the settings.yaml actually in
   force is the global one. The only diagnostic available reads as confirmation
   that their file was loaded.

   THE STATE IS A PROPERTY OF THE DEPLOYED CONFIGURATION, NOT OF THE BINARY, which
   is why the reservation outlives every reading of the flag: any phase can move it
   between LIVE and INERT without touching this file, this list, or cmd/. A
   reservation is the only form of this knowledge that survives that move, because
   it does not depend on which state is current.

   WHAT THE INERT HALF REQUIRES OF THE CONFIGURATION PHASE - stated here as a
   requirement, not as an observation of code that exists at this commit: the
   GLOBAL settings document must carry a top-level server: key that is a MAP.
   Nesting it under a profile, renaming it, splitting it across two files, or
   emitting it as an empty key all leave --config LIVE while this comment would say
   inert. That is the failure this entry cannot catch for you, because by then the
   flag is refused at render time and the settings file is wrong in a way no render
   inspects.

   FIVE READINGS OF THIS FLAG HAVE BEEN ASSERTED CONFIDENTLY AND WRONGLY, ALL IN
   ONE DAY: "redirects the entire configuration load"; "no-ops with a deprecation
   warning"; "the chart mounts nothing, so no settings file exists"; "the hub
   creates one on every boot"; and "it overlays" - each an improvement on the last
   and each still wrong. THE SHAPE THEY SHARE IS WHY THEY SURVIVED: every one of
   them reaches the correct conclusion, that the flag must be refused, so checking
   the conclusion returns "yes" and confirms the reason on the way past.
   AGREEMENT ON A CONCLUSION IS NOT CORROBORATION OF ITS REASON. If you are about
   to correct this paragraph a sixth time, compare derivations with whoever you
   agree with, not answers - that is the only comparison that has ever caught one
   of these.

   --project, -g, --grove, --profile and -p: THE REASON HERE IS DIFFERENT AND
   WEAKER THAN THE ONE THIS COMMENT USED TO GIVE, and it is written out rather
   than borrowed from --config because borrowing it is what made it wrong. They
   are declared in cmd/root.go as PERSISTENT flags, which is why three
   enumerations of cmd/server.go missed them.

   What they do NOT do: move the global configuration directory, or reach
   LoadGlobalConfig - the loader every paragraph above is about - at any point.
   The hub's server configuration is not reachable from any of them.

   What --project/-g/--grove DO do on this command, traced from the flag
   declaration outward: they set projectPath (cmd/root.go:249-250 - :248 is
   rootCmd.Long, not a flag declaration), and
   PersistentPreRunE passes projectPath to config.LoadSettings at cmd/root.go:123
   and config.LoadEffectiveSettings at :129 for EVERY command, server start
   included. Those two select which project's settings.yaml supplies cli.autohelp
   and cli.interactive_disabled, and the second can force the process
   non-interactive. It also reaches printDevAuthWarningIfNeeded (:187), which
   loads the same file again to decide whether to warn. That is a narrower effect
   than this comment used to claim - CLI-level settings, not the hub's server
   config - but it is a real one, it is configuration selection, and the chart's
   guarantee is over the whole rendered command line. The project-required check
   at :117 is NOT among them: :106-108 clears requiresProject for the server
   subtree.

   --grove binds the SAME VARIABLE as --project (cmd/root.go:249-250), so
   reserving one without the other leaves the alias open - the hosted/production
   pattern again. It is also MarkHidden, so it will not appear in --help to
   whoever checks.

   --profile/-p IS THE WEAK ENTRY AND IS LABELLED AS ONE. Its only consumer on
   this path is config.RequireImageRegistry at cmd/root.go:181, and that call is
   skipped for the server subtree at :168-170; LoadSettings does not take it.
   Every other consumer of the variable is a client subcommand. So it is INERT on
   server start today and I could find no harm for it - by axis (d), that is the
   same answer that removed the updateStrategy refusal. It survives here on the
   one ground that differs: a reserved flag costs an operator nothing they have
   any reason to want, whereas the updateStrategy refusal blocked a configuration
   operators do want. If you disagree, MOVE IT, DO NOT DELETE IT, and name the
   list it lands in - $aliasOrIgnored is where an inert-but-plausible flag goes,
   which is where --port sits for the same reason.

   THE TRIGGER THAT WOULD MAKE --profile/-p A STRONG ENTRY, named here so nobody
   has to re-derive the weakness to find out whether it still holds: any phase
   that adds a profile-aware consumer to the SERVER path, or that passes profile
   into config.LoadSettings or config.LoadEffectiveSettings. Either one turns this
   into an ordinary $neverPassed entry with the same reason as --project, and this
   paragraph should then be deleted rather than softened. Until one of them
   happens the entry is weak and is to be described as weak.

   Note that --global is NOT here. The chart renders it, so it is in $setByChart,
   which rejects it just as absolutely. Its hazard is its own and is not the
   --config hazard by another route, which is what this comment used to claim:
   --global makes the server chdir to $HOME so it operates from the global project
   context (cmd/server_foreground.go:120-130), so --global=false leaves the hub
   running from the container's working directory instead. It does not move
   $HOME/.scion, because nothing does.

3. Not the lever they appear to be. Each of these is a flag an operator could

   Per-entry, because the two are here for different failures:

   --production binds the SAME VARIABLE as --hosted (cmd/server.go:235, a
   deprecated alias). So --production=false disables hosted mode - the first
   hazard this guard was ever written for - while the operator believes they
   passed a no-op about a deprecated spelling.

   --port is the hub API port for standalone mode and is IGNORED whenever
   --enable-web is set (cmd/server.go:241), which this chart always sets. An
   operator moving the port with it changes nothing at all: the listener stays on
   --web-port, the probes still pass, and the flag they set has no effect they can

   NOT DELIVERED HERE. Live on argv, nothing to disagree with, would simply take
   effect if passed:

     db              cfg.Database.URL, cmd/server_foreground.go:875-877.
                     Arrives with Cloud SQL.
     storage-dir     cfg.Storage.LocalPath, cmd/server_foreground.go:890-892.
                     Arrives with the workspace share.
     admin-emails    cfg.Hub.AdminEmails, cmd/server_foreground.go:1402-1409 and
                     :2116-2124. Both sites read argv first and consult the
                     settings file only when argv is empty. No phase claims it.

   THIS HEADER WAS CORRECT AND STOPPED BEING CORRECT WITHOUT THE FILE BEING
   EDITED. It read "there is no second source yet for anything to disagree with"
   and "none of them lands anywhere", which were true while the chart rendered no
   ConfigMap, no Secret and no volumes, and false the moment it rendered all
   three. The refusal at the bottom of this file went stale in the same instant
   and for the same reason, which is why they are fixed together: this header is
   that refusal's justification, and fixing one alone leaves the file arguing
   with itself. An unchanged file is not evidence that its claims about the rest
   of the chart still hold - it is how they go stale unnoticed.

   ALL FIVE STAY RESERVED, AND NOT BY INERTIA. Before removing an entry, name
   where it lands instead. For base-url, storage-bucket and - since the Cloud SQL
   phase - db, that is the first list above, and the answer is still not argv.
   For the other two, admin-emails and storage-dir, it is nowhere yet. None of
   the five is rendered as an argument ($setByChart), none selects
   which configuration is loaded ($neverPassed), none is inert or misnamed
   ($aliasOrIgnored), and none weakens authentication ($unsafeToPass).

   The harm is present for three of the five and scheduled for the other two.
   Passing -base-url, -storage-bucket or -db today makes argv the silent winner
   over a value this chart rendered, and nothing logs the disagreement. -db
   joined that group when the Cloud SQL phase started rendering
   server.database.url, and the move was forced rather than remembered:
   hack/verify.sh carries the delivery state as a committed number per flag and
   goes red when a channel appears without this paragraph being re-tensed in the
   same diff. Passing admin-emails or storage-dir today changes a setting nothing
   else sets; the same silent overriding starts the day its channel lands, with
   no edit here to mark it. The
   asymmetry is what decides it - reserving costs an operator a flag they have no
   reason to want, un-reserving is a deliberate act with a place to record itself
   (see the closing paragraph), and reserving after the fact requires somebody to
   notice.

   Not verifiable against the rendered arguments, by construction - the rendered
   argument list is where these must NOT appear. Check them against the channel,
   which hack/verify.sh now does: it asserts the first list against the render and
   the second against its absence, so moving an entry between the two lists
   without moving the code, or the reverse, is a red test rather than a paragraph
   nobody re-reads.

   NAME THE CHANNEL WHEN YOU ADD AN ENTRY, because it is not the same channel for
   every entry and the precedence differs. admin-emails, db, storage-bucket and
   storage-dir belong to the settings file; base-url belongs to the
   SCION_SERVER_BASE_URL environment variable.

   Precedence for base-url, read from the hub rather than assumed, because "two
   sources" only matters if one of them silently loses:

     cmd/server_foreground.go:2102 (initWebServer, the OAuth redirect base)
       --base-url, else SCION_SERVER_BASE_URL, else http://localhost:<web-port>
     cmd/server_foreground.go:1310 (resolveHubEndpoint, the URL agents dial)
       settings file server.hub.public_url, else --base-url, else
       SCION_SERVER_BASE_URL, else project settings, else localhost

   Two consequences, both silent. ARGV BEATS THE ENVIRONMENT AT BOTH SITES, and
   the environment variable is one this chart renders, so an argv --base-url
   shadows a live value rather than a hypothetical one, with no error and, unless
   --debug is on, no log line either. And the two sites do not
   agree with each other - the settings file outranks argv when resolving the
   agent-facing endpoint but is not consulted at all for the OAuth redirect - so
   argv plus a settings file that sets public_url yields two different base URLs
   in one process, each correct by its own rule.

   That is why this entry is reserved rather than merely discouraged. A later
   phase may still choose argv as the delivery channel for base-url, and this
   list is where it says so: move the entry, do not add a second emitter beside
   the existing one. --config is the one flag that CANNOT be promoted this way,
   which is why it sits in $neverPassed instead: the condition under which
   --config stops being read is a non-nil top-level server: key in the global
   settings document, and that key is exactly what the configuration phase
   delivers (see the $neverPassed comment). Choosing --config as a delivery
   channel would disable it.

5. These weaken authentication or place credentials where they can be read.

   PER-ENTRY, WITH THE EFFECT TRACED, because "unsafe" was the entire stated
   reason for four flags until round 4 and an unexplained reservation is the kind
   that gets deleted by whoever first wants the flag. All four are declared on
   serverStartCmd, so all four reach this command.

   ALL FOUR ARE LIVE AT THIS HEAD. Unlike $ownedByConfig above, nothing here is
   forward-looking: each of these takes effect today, on this chart, as rendered.

   --session-secret (cmd/server.go:275) is the signing key for the web session
   cookie store and the hub's JWT signing keys. Two harms, not one. It is a
   credential on argv, readable by anyone who can read the pod spec - which the
   credential guard below would also catch, but only if the operator's value
   happens to look like a credential, and a passphrase does not. And it PRE-EMPTS
   the delivery channel: resolveSessionSecret (cmd/server_foreground.go:1452-1456)
   takes the flag first and only falls back to SCION_SERVER_SESSION_SECRET, so an
   argv value silently outranks the Secret-backed environment variable the
   session-secret phase mounts. THAT CHANNEL IS NOT THE SECRET THIS CHART ALREADY
   RENDERS, and the distinction is worth the sentence: this chart renders a Secret
   holding settings.yaml, and the settings file has no session-secret key at all:
   there is no such field anywhere in V1ServerConfig, and resolveSessionSecret
   reads exactly three sources in order - the flag, SCION_SERVER_SESSION_SECRET,
   then bare SESSION_SECRET for compatibility - none of which is a file. So the
   presence of a Secret in the rendered output says nothing about
   this claim, which stays forward-tensed until SCION_SERVER_SESSION_SECRET is
   emitted. Measured at this head: zero occurrences of SESSION_SECRET in every
   permutation's render.

   --dev-auth (cmd/server.go:251) IS A DIRECT WRITE TO cfg.Auth.Enabled AT
   cmd/server_foreground.go:884-886, AND THE DANGEROUS DIRECTION IS TRUE, NOT
   FALSE. Worth stating explicitly because the natural reading is backwards. The
   workstation defaults that would turn dev auth on (applyWorkstationDefaults,
   cmd/server_config.go:35-37, and the assignment at server_foreground.go:843) are
   BOTH inside an if !hostedMode block, and this chart renders --hosted, so they
   do not run: cfg.Auth.Enabled is false here and --dev-auth=false merely restates
   the default. Passing --dev-auth (or =true) is what changes something - it
   satisfies the gate at :212 and initialises dev-token authentication in a hosted
   deployment, standing an auto-generated static token up beside the real identity
   path. That one is not silent (:216-217 logs a warning in hosted mode), but a
   warning in a log nobody reads is not a control, and a render error is.

   --enable-test-login (cmd/server.go:252) is wired to the web server at
   cmd/server_foreground.go:2163 and registers POST /api/v1/auth/test-login
   (pkg/hub/web.go:747). The route is always mounted and the flag is the gate:
   pkg/hub/handlers_test_login.go:52-55 returns 403 unless it is set, after which
   the handler mints a user session behind a challenge token rather than the
   configured identity provider. Also warned about at :2167-2168, and the same
   answer applies.

   --web-assets-dir (cmd/server.go:274) replaces the embedded web UI with a
   directory served straight off the container filesystem: pkg/hub/web.go:497
   stores it and :832-833 hands it to http.FileServer(http.Dir(...)). It is here
   rather than in $ownedByConfig because the hazard is not a second source for a
   value - it is that the served asset tree stops being the audited one that was
   built into the image.

ADJUDICATED AND DELIBERATELY NOT RESERVED. The five lists above say what is
refused; a reader auditing them for COMPLETENESS needs to know which flags were
considered and let through, or they re-derive the same six every time. Round 4
raised these by name. None is reserved, and the ground is given per flag rather
than as one blanket sentence, because a blanket sentence is what would survive a
change that falsified it.

  --no-auto-migrate (cmd/server.go:244). RAISED AS THE ONE MOST LIKELY TO
    INTERACT WITH THE STARTUP BUDGET. IT DOES NOT, and that is the finding, not
    an absence of one: it gates only the in-process upgrade of a LEGACY raw-SQL
    hub.db to the Ent schema (cmd/server_foreground.go:1263-1266, which errors out
    when it finds one and the flag is set). CompositeStore.Migrate - the ordered
    sequence assertStartupBudget is written against - is not behind it and runs
    either way. A fresh GKE pod has no legacy hub.db, so the flag is inert here.
  --debug (cmd/server.go:255). Logging verbosity. Note it SHADOWS the persistent
    --debug at cmd/root.go:267: a local flag of the same name wins, so this sets
    enableDebug and not debugMode. Harmless either way, and recorded only so the
    duplicate is not mistaken for a finding later.
  --runtime-broker-port (cmd/server.go:248). Sets cfg.RuntimeBroker.Port
    (server_foreground.go:881-883). The chart renders --enable-runtime-broker but
    no port, exposes no broker port on the Service and points no probe at one, so
    moving it stays internally consistent inside the pod.
  --template-cache-dir, --template-cache-max (cmd/server.go:262-263). Cache
    location and size. No auth, config-selection or credential surface.
  --simulate-remote-broker (cmd/server.go:266). Test-path selector that skips
    co-located optimisations. Degrades performance, weakens nothing.

IF YOU ARE ADDING TO THIS BLOCK, the bar is the one axis (d) sets: a flag stays
off the reserved lists when no harm was FOUND, not when none was looked for. Say
which it was.

THE INVARIANT THAT MAKES $setByChart SELF-CHECKING, IN BOTH DIRECTIONS.

$setByChart and the flags rendered above must be the SAME SET. Two containments,
four lines, and they catch opposite mistakes:

  A. rendered is a subset of $setByChart - catches a flag the chart passes that
     nobody reserved. The list was incomplete twice this way: six flags the chart
     itself renders (foreground, enable-hub, enable-runtime-broker, enable-web,
     auto-provide, global) were missing, and because pflag is last-wins an
     operator could append --enable-runtime-broker=false and get a hub that stays
     Ready, keeps its RBAC, and can never launch an agent.

  B. $setByChart is a subset of rendered - catches a member the chart claims to
     set and does not. Two entries sat here that the chart never emitted, under
     the comment above telling the maintainer to delete entries not present in
     the rendered args: a deletion instruction pointed at two live guards, one of
     them --production, whose removal reopens disable-hosted-mode because it
     binds the same variable as --hosted. They are in $aliasOrIgnored now, and
     direction B is what keeps them out rather than the comment.

A alone was implemented first and would not have caught B's case at all. Both
mistakes are the same mistake - the list and the render drifting - and one
containment only ever sees one direction of drift.

DIRECTION B IS MEANINGFUL FOR $setByChart AND FOR NO OTHER LIST. The other three
are reserved precisely BECAUSE the chart does not render them, so for them the
empty intersection is the expected steady state forever. That is what the split
into reasons bought beyond documentation: it isolated the one group whose
membership is a checkable claim about this file, and made it checkable.

Both run against the chart's own arguments only, before hub.args is appended, so
they assert a property of THIS FILE rather than of operator input.

IF A LATER PHASE RENDERS A FLAG CONDITIONALLY, BUILD $setByChart BESIDE THE
RENDER - append to both inside the same if - rather than weakening either
containment. I had argued for keeping A one-directional on the grounds that B
would fire on a legitimate conditional flag; that was the wrong trade. It buys a
future convenience with a present hole, and the convenience is available anyway
by keeping the list and the command in step, which is the thing being asserted.

CONSIDERED AND REJECTED: deriving $setByChart from $args. It would make both
containments true by construction and delete this block, and that is precisely
the objection - DERIVING ONE SIDE OF A COMPARISON FROM THE OTHER PRODUCES A CHECK
THAT CANNOT FAIL. Both directions become tautologies over a set defined as the
thing they are compared against, and the render stays green forever whatever the
command does.

That is a different move from removing a coupling, though the two look identical
in a diff. service.port and hub.webPort need no assertion because targetPort: http
means there is no longer anything to violate - the INVARIANT is gone. Deriving
this list would leave the invariant exactly as breachable as it is now and delete
only the CHECK. Prefer the first; refuse the second.

A second and lesser objection, kept because it is independently true: the
derivation silently expands the operator-facing reserved set every time a
maintainer adds a flag to the command, which is a contract change with nothing
announcing it.

The explicit list is the statement; these two checks are what keep the statement
true.

KNOWN LIMIT OF THE SCAN BELOW: it classifies an element as a flag by a leading
"-", so a flag whose VALUE is in the next element and itself starts with "-"
would be counted as a flag of its own, and direction A would report a chart
defect naming something that is not a flag. Nothing the chart renders today
looks like that - every space-separated value is an address, a port or a path -
and the failure is loud, immediate and names the offending token, so it cannot
ship silently. THE REMEDY IF IT EVER FIRES: walk $args pairwise, remembering
whether the previous element was a flag that takes a separate value, instead of
testing each element independently. Written down rather than pre-implemented,
because the pairwise walk needs a list of which flags take values, and that list
would be a third thing to keep in step with the command.

A POSITIONAL IS IGNORED BY pflag, BUT ITS TEXT IS STILL ON argv.

The reserved-list checks above are deliberately flag-only: pflag does not read a
positional as a flag, so `global` or `c` alone cannot replace anything the chart
set, and failing the render on them was a false positive that blocked legitimate
values. That reasoning is sound for the BARE word, and the bare word is the
benign member of the class.

It does not extend to `name=value`. Nothing is SET - pflag still ignores it - but
`session-secret=hunter2` puts the secret in the pod spec and in /proc/1/cmdline,
readable by anyone with pod read access. That is the same harm $unsafeToPass and
the value axis below exist to prevent, reached by a spelling that skips both.

So the name axis, and only the name axis, runs on the left of the `=`. It judges
the NAME, so it stays silent on `global=y` and `token-ttl=5m` and fires on names
whose trailing hyphen-separated word says the value is credential material. No
list is consulted here on purpose: a positional cannot misconfigure the hub, it
can only expose, so exposure is the only thing worth failing on.

That is the whole of what this catches, and the limit is worth stating because
the axis it leans on is narrow. It does NOT catch a credential passed with no
name at all - a bare positional `hunter2` - and it cannot: there is no sound way
to recognise an arbitrary high-entropy string without failing renders that are
fine. The value axis below is not a backstop for that either. It matches URL and
query-string credentials and known prefixes, so it is silent on any secret whose
shape is unremarkable, and separately on any secret containing a character the
userinfo encoder rewrites - which is most of what a password policy would call
strong. Detect by structure, never by matching the value.

The name is trimmed before it is judged. `regexMatch` is anchored, so a derived
name that kept a trailing space could not match the credential pattern and
`session-secret =hunter2` rendered clean with the secret on argv. Neither
whitespace guard above reaches that spelling: the trim check at the top compares
the whole entry and this one's ends are ordinary characters, and the whitespace
check is flag-only, which a positional never enters.

Do not "simplify" this by moving it back inside the hasPrefix block. It exists
precisely because that block does not run for this spelling.

The underscore is translated rather than passed through, which the name axis
asks every caller to decide and which the FLAG path above deliberately does not
do. The two answers differ because the reasons differ. On the flag path an
underscore is a real error - no flag on `server start` has one, so pflag would
reject --some_var and the hub would crash-loop - and failing says so at render
time. A positional is never parsed as a flag, so there is no crash-loop to warn
about and that reason does not transfer. Passing `some_var=value` through
untranslated failed the render with a message telling the operator to translate
before calling, which is advice addressed to this line, not to them: a false
positive of exactly the kind the hasPrefix fix was written to remove. Translated,
`some_var=value` renders and `session_secret=hunter2` fails for its real reason.

=============================================================================
Configuration intake: the rendered settings.yaml
=============================================================================

The hub is configured by a settings.yaml file, not by SCION_SERVER_* environment
variables. That is not a style preference.

THE RULE, MEASURED. On the path this chart uses, loadGlobalConfigFromSettings
calls applyEnvOverrides (pkg/config/hub_config.go:683 and :1191), which maps each
name through envKeyToConfigKey (:976): lowercase, split on "_", replace any
segment that has an entry in the camelCaseFields table (:919), join with ".".
So a SCION_SERVER_ name binds if and only if EVERY underscore-separated segment
is either a plain lowercase word matching its koanf tag or has a table entry.
Anything else produces a key that matches no field, and k.Unmarshal (:1198) is
called without ErrorUnused, so it is discarded with no error, no warning and no
log line.

Worked both ways, because the reachable half is the part that was wrong here for
three phases:

  SCION_SERVER_DATABASE_DRIVER  -> database.driver   BINDS
  SCION_SERVER_DATABASE_URL     -> database.url      BINDS
  SCION_SERVER_OIDC_ENABLED     -> oidc.enabled      BINDS
  SCION_SERVER_DATABASE_MAX_OPEN_CONNS -> database.max.open.conns  discarded
                                   (koanf tag is max_open_conns; the underscores
                                    became dots before anything could rejoin them)
  SCION_SERVER_OIDC_ISSUER_URL  -> oidc.issuer.url   discarded, same reason
                                   (OIDCProviderConfig.IssuerURL, koanf issuer_url)
  SCION_SERVER_OIDC_ISSUERURL   -> oidc.issuerurl    discarded, DIFFERENT reason
                                   (OIDCLoginConfig.IssuerURL is koanf issuerUrl
                                    and "issuerurl" has no camelCaseFields entry)

Two failure modes, one symptom. TestEnvKeyToConfigKey has DATABASE_DRIVER as an
explicit passing sub-case, so "the database keyspace binds under no spelling" was
one `go test` away from being checked at any point.

AND A DISCARDED VARIABLE IS NOT SILENT DOWNSTREAM - IT IS REPORTED AS APPLIED.
DetectEnvOverrides (pkg/config/opsettings/koanf.go:347) is `envKoanf.Keys()`: it
returns every SCION_SERVER_ name in the environment, having never asked whether
any of them reached a field. So the admin server-config view lists a dropped
variable as an active override. Worse than silence.

Reject any operator-supplied environment variable that would desynchronise the
chart's guards from the hub's configuration.

THE REASON CHANGED AND THE REFUSAL DID NOT. This guard used to be defended on the
grounds that SCION_SERVER_DATABASE_* and SCION_SERVER_OIDC_* are "unreachable by
any spelling". That is FALSE - see the intake section above - and a guard
defended by a false premise gets deleted the moment somebody checks the premise.
gd-p2-dev and gd-p3-dev checked it, from opposite ends, against a passing test in
the repo.

THE HARM, MEASURED THROUGH THE HUB. applyEnvOverrides runs AFTER settings.yaml is
loaded (pkg/config/hub_config.go:683) and wins, so a bound SCION_SERVER_DATABASE_
variable silently overrides the file this chart renders. Measured: minimal's
settings.yaml says driver: sqlite; with SCION_SERVER_DATABASE_DRIVER=postgres in
the environment, config.LoadGlobalConfig reports driver "postgres",
isHADeployment (cmd/server_foreground.go:927) flips to TRUE, and the hub aborts
at the hosted HA preflight - from a release that assertHAUnlanded passed, because
assertHAUnlanded reads .Values.database.driver, which still says sqlite.

That is the harm and it is specific to this chart: the chart's guards reason
about the configuration the chart RENDERED, and this variable changes the
configuration the hub RUNS. Every premise those guards rest on stops being true,
and nothing anywhere reports it.

The chart's own templates emit no such variable; hub.extraEnv is the one place an
operator could add one, and these two prefixes are the most likely mistake
because they are the settings a chart most wants to deliver.

THE SHADOW LIST IS READ OUT OF THE RENDERED ConfigMap, NOT WRITTEN DOWN HERE.

emitted conditionally, which is to say the two a hand-maintained list was always
going to miss.

Rendering the ConfigMap and taking its keys makes the two lists the same list.
Adding a variable to the ConfigMap without adding it to this guard stops being
expressible, which is the only version of "keep these in sync" that is a
mechanism rather than a request. It also gets the conditional keys exactly
right: when hub.adminMode is unset the chart emits nothing to shadow, and an
extraEnv entry of that name is legitimately allowed.

POD_NAMESPACE is the one literal, and it has to be. It is not in the ConfigMap -
it is a fieldRef in the container's env list, which cannot be rendered from here

The same two rules the argument guard applies to argv, applied to env, through
the same two shared helpers rather than a second near-miss copy of them. A
literal value here is stored in the Deployment and readable by anyone who can

set that grows every time somebody is granted "just read access to the

reference, not the material, so neither a name nor a value test has anything to
say about it.

Both are conditioned on the entry actually carrying a literal, for that reason.

THE UNDERSCORE IS WHY $name IS TRANSLATED BEFORE THE NAME CHECK.
scion-hub.assertNoCredentialName matches a credential noun as a whole trailing
SEGMENT, and its segment separator is the hyphen, because it was written for
flag names. Environment variable names separate with underscores, so passing
SESSION_SECRET to it unchanged matches nothing at all: the guard renders, reads
as applied, and is inert. Translating _ to - puts the name into the alphabet the
helper's positional rule is expressed in, and the rule then means the same thing
on both axes - SESSION_SECRET is caught, TOKEN_TTL_SECONDS and MAX_TOKENS are
not. verify.sh asserts the catch and both non-catches, so a regression here
cannot pass as "no false positives".

Do not "simplify" this by widening the shared helper's character class instead.
The translation belongs to the caller whose names use underscores; the helper is
shared with argv, where the hyphen rule is the correct one.

THE VALUES THAT REACH settings.yaml AND ONLY settings.yaml, AND WHAT THEY WRITE.
The single source for that list. NOTES.txt renders it, values.yaml repeats it in
prose at config.existingSecret, and hack/verify.sh checks all three against the
render rather than against each other.

Under config.existingSecret the chart writes no settings.yaml, so each of these
values silently does nothing and the operator's own file has to carry the key on
the right. That is the whole content of the list: what you now owe.

WHY THESE ARE DOCUMENTED AND THE THREE BELOW ARE REFUSED, WHICH IS NOT A
JUDGEMENT ABOUT WHICH MATTER MORE. It is about what a template can see. Helm
hands a template the MERGED values and no way to ask which of them the operator
actually wrote, so intent is only legible where the chart's default is empty:
config.extra, storage.bucket and agents.imageRegistry are empty by default, so a
non-empty one was typed by someone and can be refused. Every value here has a
non-empty default - auth.mode is "proxy", hub.name is "Scion Hub",
database.maxOpenConns is 25 - and a guard on truthiness would fire on a values
file that never mentioned them. There is no third option: a literal copy of the
default inside the guard is a second source of truth for the default, and it
goes stale in exactly the direction that turns the guard off.

So this list is not a weaker refusal. It is the part of the same problem that a
refusal cannot express, and it is checked to the same standard: hack/verify.sh
mutates every leaf of values.yaml, renders, and requires each value whose only
effect is on the settings document to be EITHER refused by the guard below OR
named here with the settings key its mutation actually moved. A value in neither
place fails the suite, and so does an entry here that no longer moves the key it
claims. The pairs below were produced by that probe, not written from memory.

Both columns are load-bearing. The left tells an operator which of their values
went nowhere; the right tells them what to write instead, which is the only half
they can act on, and it is not guessable from the left - hub.name becomes
server.hub.hub_name, and rbac.agentNamespace and runtime.namespace both become
the same runtimes.kubernetes.namespace.

config.existingSecret means "I supply the whole settings.yaml myself", so the
chart renders none - and every value whose only effect is on the file it did not
render becomes inert. An inert value is the same silent no-op this whole design
exists to avoid, so supplying both is an error rather than a precedence rule.

The three names below are the settings values with an empty default, which is
what makes them refusable at all; the reasoning is in the comment above the
transfer list, and the two lists are checked together as one partition of the
values tree. Later phases append their own inline values here as they are
introduced (the database password, the session secret, the OAuth client secret).

Two settings values are missing from the list on purpose and are covered anyway.
storage.provider and database.driver have non-empty defaults, so neither can be
refused on truthiness - but the only other value each can take (gcs, postgres)
is one the chart already requires storage.bucket alongside, so any render that
moves either of them is refused for the bucket. hack/verify.sh proves that by
mutation rather than by argument; if a later phase makes either reachable
without a bucket, that check goes red rather than the pair going quiet.

MUST be called from a template that always renders. Calling it only from
scion-hub.settings does not work, and does not look broken: the settings
template is reached through secret-settings.yaml, which is itself skipped when
config.existingSecret is set - so the one configuration this check exists to
reject is the one configuration in which it never runs. deployment.yaml calls
it; keep that call.

The HA acknowledgement gate.

WHAT IT IS FOR. This chart can render a configuration that satisfies the hub's
isHADeployment test (cmd/server_foreground.go:927), which turns on
validateHostedHAPreflight (:951). That preflight has thirteen gates and this
release cannot satisfy the ones listed below, so the hub aborts at
cmd/server_foreground.go:151-153 before it serves anything. The postgres/gcs
shape is a choice an operator can coherently have made, so this is an opt-in
acknowledgement rather than a refusal.

MEASURED, gate by gate, through config.LoadGlobalConfig and the real
validateHostedHAPreflight, on the settings.yaml this chart actually renders -
not read off this table. cmd/helm_chart_ha_contract_test.go walks it and writes
hack/ha-gates.txt; hack/verify.sh checks this table against that walk in both
directions. If the hub gains or loses a gate, that check goes red and this table
is what has to move. THERE IS NO COUNT ANYWHERE IN THIS FILE, deliberately: a
count is the thing that agreed with itself in three places for a day while
agreeing with the hub in none.

ci/values-settings.yaml, in hub order:

  GATE TABLE BEGIN
    a durable session/signing secret           session-secret phase
    server.auth.proxy.provider=iap             ingress/IAP phase
    server.auth.proxy.iap.audience             ingress/IAP phase
    server.auth.transport                      ingress/IAP phase
    server.auth.transport.mode=iap             ingress/IAP phase
    server.auth.transport.oidc_audience        ingress/IAP phase
    server.auth.transport.platform_auth_sa     ingress/IAP phase
  GATE TABLE END

ci/values-settings-oauth.yaml refuses on one gate more, server.auth.mode=proxy,
which is not an unlanded phase - it is the operator's own auth.mode being
incompatible with HA detection. It sorts after the session secret and before the
proxy family.

THE FIVE IN CIRCULATION WERE A PROBE'S EXTENT, NOT THE HUB'S. That walk stopped
at server.auth.transport because the prober could not satisfy it, and its stop
was read as the preflight's end. Gates lie past that wall and they are real.
A later walk supplying a WELL-FORMED IAP audience missed a further refusal,
isSupportedIAPAudience, which is a second objection to the value of
server.auth.proxy.iap.audience rather than a table row. Both mistakes are the
same mistake: reporting what the probe reached as what the hub does.

WHAT THIS CHART ALREADY SATISFIES, so nobody re-derives it: server.hub.hub_id,
server.database.driver=postgres, server.storage.provider=gcs with a bucket, and
- since the Cloud SQL phase - server.database.url. Those four are why the refusal
starts where it does rather than at the hub's first gate. The URL is satisfied
only where the chart renders a settings.yaml, so under config.existingSecret it
is the operator's again, and the table above is the list for the rendering case.

server.database.url LEFT THE TABLE ABOVE BECAUSE THE WALK STOPPED NAMING IT, not
because this phase decided it had landed. TestHelmChartHAGateWalk's authored
tripwire went red with "gates the authored list names and the hub no longer
refuses on: [server.database.url]" and this edit is the response to that line.

THE ROUTE SET IS TRANSCRIBED FROM THE HUB, NOT INVENTED HERE.
cmd/server_ha_preflight_test.go:248-256 (ab0d227, branch
scion/ha-deployment-tripwire - not an ancestor of this branch; fetch that ref to
read it) WILL make this a two-way contract once it lands: a route added there
and not here makes this condition UNDER-trigger, rendering an HA config with no
acknowledgement, which cannot boot; a route removed or swapped there and not
here makes it OVER-trigger, demanding an acknowledgement for a deployment that
is not HA. All three routes are transcribed below. Grep this tree for
acknowledgeHAUnlanded to find it, as that comment instructs.

Route 1 is K_SERVICE, and it is NOT dead here. GKE does not set it, but
hub.extraEnv does - measured, it renders - so an operator can turn HA detection
on through a channel that looks unrelated to the database. The hub tests
os.Getenv("K_SERVICE") != "", so an explicit empty value is not the route; a
valueFrom is counted, because the chart cannot read it and under-triggering is
the outcome that will not boot.

Routes 2 and 3 use lower-cased comparison because the hub uses strings.EqualFold
(:931, :934), while auth.mode is compared exactly (:934) and so is compared
exactly here. The schema already enums all three to lower case, which makes the
difference unobservable today - transcribed faithfully anyway, because the
contract above is with the hub's test and not with the schema.

NOT EVALUATED UNDER config.existingSecret, and that is a real hole rather than
an oversight: the chart renders no settings.yaml in that shape, so it cannot see
the driver, the storage provider or the auth mode. Route 1 is still checked,
because extraEnv is the chart's own value either way.

Shared deliberately, and it is NOT the same decision as the gate list. The
routes are a computed property of these values and must be identical in both

with a parity check over the copies rather than a shared definition.

The top-level server: key, and it carries a load-bearing property that nothing
else in this file would suggest.

It is not only that the hub's configuration lives under it. It is that EMITTING
THIS KEY IS WHAT MAKES --config INERT. Not "--config is inert" - it is not, as a
general fact, and writing it that way is how the property gets dropped. At Phase
0, which rendered no settings Secret, the flag was fully live.

AND NOT BECAUSE NO FILE EXISTED. A global settings.yaml may well exist without
this chart writing one: the hub seeds it from its own embedded defaults on a
first boot (cmd/server_foreground.go:104-109 -> config.InitMachine,
pkg/config/init.go:588-599), and those defaults carry no server key.
loadServerFromSettingsFile does not test existence, it tests the key
(:1344-1347).

THE TRIGGER IS THE KEY, NOT THE FILE, which is the whole reason this assertion
is worth its lines. "The chart mounts a settings.yaml" does not keep --config
inert. Nest the server section under a profile, rename it, deliver it in a
second file - every one of those still mounts a settings.yaml, and every one of
them hands the flag back its effect. This phase supplies the key; drop it and the
deployment is back where Phase 0 was.

  LoadGlobalConfig            pkg/config/hub_config.go:628
  loadGlobalConfigFromSettings                        :640

WHAT THE FLAG DOES WHEN IT IS LIVE, WHICH IS NOT A REDIRECT. It cannot be one:
GetGlobalDir (pkg/config/paths.go:188-194) is os.UserHomeDir() joined with
GlobalDir and TAKES NO ARGUMENTS, so no flag value can move the directory the
hub reads first. Dropping this key opens two narrower routes instead:

  :648-659  the --config path's own directory is searched for a settings.yaml,
            and if that file has a server key it becomes the SOLE source of the
            server config - a substitution of that section, nothing merged
  :635      failing that, loadGlobalConfigLegacy(configPath) (:699), which loads
            defaults, then ~/.scion/server.yaml (:772-775), then LAYERS the
            --config path over the result (:777-787) - an overlay

Both are real and neither is "the whole configuration load moves". Keep the
distinction: a mitigation scoped to preventing redirection does not cover an
overlay. A settings.yaml of only profiles and runtimes - a plausible
minimisation, and one that would look like a simplification - is what opens
them.

IN THE INERT STATE IT IS A NO-OP WITH NO SIGNAL, WHICH IS WHY THIS ASSERTION IS
THE ONLY WARNING THERE WILL EVER BE. --config is not marked deprecated -

server.hub.public_url is refused outright. This is the only assertion in this
file that guards a channel the chart itself owns, and that is exactly why it was
missing until someone went looking.

The base URL has two consumers and they do not read the same source. Read from
the hub rather than assumed, and every step verified independently by review:

  settings_v1.go:517            PublicURL carries koanf:"public_url"
  settings_v1.go:1404-1405      if v1.Hub.PublicURL != "" { gc.Hub.Endpoint = it }
  server_foreground.go:1311-12  resolveHubEndpoint returns cfg.Hub.Endpoint - and
                                this is its FIRST statement, ahead of --base-url
                                at :1323 and SCION_SERVER_BASE_URL at :1331
  server_foreground.go:2102-08  initWebServer never reads cfg.Hub.Endpoint

So public_url outranks both other channels for the agent endpoint, and the OAuth
side cannot see it at any precedence. SCION_SERVER_BASE_URL is the only source
both consumers honour, which is why the chart sets that and nothing else - it
makes the two agree by construction rather than by the operator keeping them in
step.

REFUSED OUTRIGHT, not merely when it disagrees with hub.baseUrl. Permitting an
equal value would create a second source of truth that has to be kept in sync,
and the failure of that sync IS the bug: set both equal today, change hub.baseUrl
tomorrow, and you get the split - from a values file that passed the guard on the
day it was written. The permissive rule guards the moment of authorship, not the
lifetime of the file, and there is nothing on the other side of the trade. A
public_url equal to baseUrl buys the operator nothing, so the only configurations
it would admit are the ones that are useless now and dangerous later.

Rendering public_url therefore does not override the base URL. It SPLITS it: the
agent endpoint moves and the OAuth redirect does not, in one process, with both
values looking correct from their own side and no line in any manifest that
looks wrong. The failure surfaces later as redirects to the wrong host.

Reachable today, not hypothetically: config.extra is deep-merged over this tree
before these assertions run, so config.extra.server.hub.public_url renders. That
is the path hack/verify.sh proves this assertion against. The argv channel is
closed by the reserved-flag list and the environment channel by the schema; this
is the third channel and the chart is the only thing that writes it.

public_url is an ALIAS: a settings key that is a second name for a value the
chart already sets through a different channel. That is the hazard, and it is
not the server.hub prefix - nothing about that prefix is dangerous, and an alias
need not live anywhere near the value it renames. The collision check below
cannot see this one either, because the chart never writes public_url; the two
rules cover disjoint halves.

So this is a denylist of one, and Phase 5a owns replacing it with the alias
enumeration: every settings key that is a second name for something the chart
sets elsewhere, derived by walking what the chart sets and asking what else
names each quantity. Small, closed, checkable from the chart side alone, and it
narrows config.extra not at all. Phase 5a because it is the phase that wants a
public hostname and will reach for this key first.

Do not add a second key here instead of converting it. The failure mode of a
denylist of one is not that it stays at one - it is that the second key goes in
cheaply and the addition makes the list look adequate. Two entries read as a
considered policy; one entry reads as a stub, and a stub is the only thing that
ever gets converted.

config.extra may add settings. It may not silently overwrite ones the chart

This is the settings-file analogue of the reserved-flag list, and it is the same
argument one channel over: a value the chart computes and an operator's override
of it are indistinguishable in the rendered output, so the manifest keeps
reporting the operator's intent and every assertion downstream of the merge
still passes. The difference from the flag list is that this one needs no
enumeration - both documents are in hand at merge time, so the rule is derived
rather than listed, and it cannot be incomplete the way a list can.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT CATCH, and it is deliberate rather than an oversight. It sees
only keys the chart WRITES. It cannot see an ALIAS - a settings key that is a
second name for a value the chart already sets through a different channel.
server.hub.public_url is exactly that: the chart controls the base URL through
hub.baseUrl -> SCION_SERVER_BASE_URL and never writes public_url, so this check
is silent on it and the explicit refusal in assertSettings is what catches it.
The two rules cover disjoint halves and neither can see the other's. Phase 5a
owns enumerating the aliases; do not delete either rule believing the other
covers it.

Runs AFTER assertSettings so that a collision on a key with its own assertion -
the hub ID, the driver, server.mode, schema_version - still reports that
assertion's specific message. A generic "you overwrote a key" would be a

Percent-encode one userinfo component of a URL.

The IAM database role is a Google service account with the domain trimmed, so

at the LAST @, so the raw two-@ form does in fact parse correctly - I measured
it against the hub's real parser rather than assuming it. It is still encoded
here, for two reasons that outlive that measurement:

  - The last-@ rule is net/url's, not RFC 3986's. Any intermediary that splits
    at the FIRST @ - a log scrubber, a URL rewriter, a different language's
    parser - reads the host as "my-project.iam@127.0.0.1:5432" and is wrong in

  - The password arm has no such luck. A password containing @ or : is
    misparsed outright, and that is an operator's arbitrary string, not a
    Google-shaped identifier.

% MUST BE FIRST or it re-encodes the escapes emitted after it. The set is the
RFC 3986 userinfo-illegal characters that can plausibly occur here; a character
outside it passes through unchanged, which is correct - over-encoding a legal

entry carrying restartPolicy: Always; on clusters below 1.29 it is an ordinary

placements cannot drift into being two different proxies - the failure this
would otherwise invite is a fix applied to the native path and not the fallback,
which nobody runs until the day they run it on an old cluster.

restartPolicy is added by the CALLER, not here, because it is the single field

    THE PROXY DOES NOT RUN AS ITS IMAGE'S OWN UID. The image declares USER

    hub.securityContext.runAsUser (1000 by default) and that is inherited by

    opt a single container back out of a pod-level runAsUser - it can be
    overridden, not unset - so this is a property of the pod, not a choice made
    here. It is recorded because the obvious reading of the image is wrong.

    That is EXPECTED to be harmless: the proxy writes nothing, opens no
    uid-owned files, and needs only a socket and the metadata server. It is
    NOT VERIFIED, because verifying it requires running the pod and there is no
    cluster - see VALIDATION.md, where it sits with the rest of the unrun smoke

The hub's in-process runtime broker port. ONE SOURCE, TWO READERS.

This number is written into server.broker.port in the settings document and is
also an entry in the port-collision guard below, and those two are not
independent facts: the guard's entire job is to refuse an operator port that
collides with what the settings file actually configures. It was a bare 9800 in
both places, including inside a human-readable message. Two fields that must
agree are two fields that can disagree, and this pair would disagree SILENTLY -
the settings file would move, the guard would keep refusing the old port, and
the new collision it exists to catch would render clean.

Nothing in the values surface sets this today and this helper deliberately does
not add one: the broker is in-process and its port is not an operator's to
choose. It is a helper so that the two readers cannot drift, not to make the
number configurable. hack/verify.sh measures the linkage from outside, deriving
the port from the rendered settings document rather than naming it.

Port collisions inside the pod's single network namespace.

boundary - it is an ordinary bind conflict, and the loser fails at startup with
"address already in use" while the manifest looks entirely reasonable, because
each port is declared in a different container's block and nothing in the
Kubernetes API cross-checks them.

Four ports live in this namespace once the proxy is added, and only two of them
are visible in the Deployment: the hub's web port and the proxy's two. The
fourth, the hub's in-process runtime broker on 9800, is set in settings.yaml and
does not appear in the pod spec at all - so an operator who moves the proxy's
health port onto it gets a conflict with a process they cannot see declared
anywhere nearby. That is the case this guard is really for.

{{/*
The native sidecar's version requirement, asserted where it applies.

THIS REPLACES A kubeVersion FLOOR IN Chart.yaml, AND THE REASON IT IS HERE
INSTEAD OF THERE IS THAT THE REQUIREMENT IS CONDITIONAL ON A VALUE. Chart.yaml's
kubeVersion is evaluated before any value is read, so ">=1.29.0-0" rejected
every cluster below 1.29 - including the ones cloudsql.nativeSidecar: false
exists to serve, and which values.yaml and NOTES.txt both tell the operator to
use. gd-p2-rev measured that contradiction. The requirement is real, but it is
the requirement of one branch of one template, so it is asserted from that
branch.

WHY Major/Minor AND NOT semverCompare. .Capabilities.KubeVersion.Version is
whatever the API server reports, and real ones are not plain semver: GKE reports
v1.29.4-gke.1043002, and Minor is frequently "28+" on managed distributions.
semverCompare on those strings either errors or silently mis-orders them, and
the usual workaround - stripping non-digits before comparing - turns
1.28.5-gke.1200 into 1.28.51200, which compares as NEWER than 1.29. Comparing
the two integers directly has none of those failure modes.

WHY THIS DOES NOT REFUSE A VERSION IT CANNOT PARSE, AND WHY THAT IS NOT THE
SAME AS PASSING. If Minor does not yield a number, the only honest statement is
that this render does not know the cluster's version - and "unknown" is not
"below 1.29". Refusing there would block a conformant 1.33 cluster whose only
sin is an unusual version string, and the remedy the message names (set
nativeSidecar false) would then push it into the crash-loop window NOTES.txt
warns about, which is worse than where it started.

🔴 SO THE THIRD OUTCOME IS LOUD. There are three results here, not two: refused,
checked-and-fine, and NOT CHECKED. The third one emits a notice into the
rendered manifest and into NOTES.txt naming the version string it could not
read. A guard that silently declines to guard is indistinguishable from a guard
that ran and approved, and the whole reason this replaced a kubeVersion floor is
that an unasserted claim looked like a checked one for weeks. Per the lead's
standing rule: pass, fail and did-not-measure are three outcomes and the third
one says so.

WHY THE DECISION TAKES ITS INPUTS AS ARGUMENTS. .Capabilities cannot be forged
from the command line - helm parses --kube-version as semver and always hands
the template a numeric Major and Minor - so the not-checked branch is
UNREACHABLE FROM helm template AND WOULD HAVE SHIPPED UNTESTED. Taking the two
strings as parameters makes the branch reachable from a probe template, which is
how hack/verify.sh gets at it. The caller in deployment.yaml is what binds them
to the real cluster; this define does the deciding and nothing else.

matrix in which every row was run. The oauth branch below is theirs and is

change this helper, that gate is where you find out.

Keep the define body byte-identical to the phase 3 copy where you can: both

for as long as that stays true. The known deltas are the floor constant and the

The marker count above proves the edits landed at the paths the helper knows.
It cannot prove the same credential is not ALSO sitting at some path the list
does not know about, so each rendered credential is searched for by value in the
finished projection.

THE FLOOR. That search is a plain substring test, and a short credential
collides with ordinary prose: measured, a client secret of "def" is found inside
the word "default" in the rendered settings, and the render was refused with a
message telling the maintainer to add a path that does not exist. False, loud,
and with remediation advice that cannot be followed. So the value search applies
only at 12 characters or more. Google issues 24-character client secrets and
GitHub 40, so no real credential is below the floor.

WHAT THE FLOOR CANNOT SEE, STATED PLAINLY: a credential shorter than 12
characters copied to a path outside the redaction list would be digested and
this check would not say so. The path redaction still applies to every path it
knows, the marker count still proves those landed, and a secret that short is
not a secret. This is a narrowed check, not a disabled one, and it is narrowed
in the direction that removes false refusals rather than the direction that
removes refusals.

AND THE ONE CASE NEITHER HALF COVERS, BECAUSE A MUTATION FOUND IT RATHER THAN
REASONING. The marker count proves a marker EXISTS; it does not prove the marker
is at the right key. Rewriting the `set` above to a misspelled key leaves the
credential in place AND inserts a marker, so the count still balances - and with
a sub-floor credential the value check is silent too. Measured: the render
succeeds and `client_secret: shrt` reaches the digest. Both guards see the same
mutation the moment the credential is of realistic length, and removing the
`set` outright is caught at any length, so what is uncovered is the intersection
of two unlikely things. It is written down rather than closed because a guard
whose gap is named is a guard someone can widen; an unnamed one is a guard
people trust past its edge. */ -}}
