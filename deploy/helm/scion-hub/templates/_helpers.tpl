runAsNonRoot is a literal true. It is not read from a value, there is no knob

reintroduced as an override. The point is not hardening in the abstract: the
artifact this project publishes under the name "scion-hub" runs as root, and an
operator who reasons from the artifact name will eventually point the chart at
it. With a loose security context that image runs as root, and once the Filestore

agents running as uid 1000 cannot write - a failure that surfaces days later and
looks like a storage problem. The REFUSAL is present-tense even though that

image fails admission today, share or no share, and says why.

runAsUser and runAsGroup stay configurable because they must be able to match the

The startup budget, asserted as a DURATION rather than as a threshold count.

periodSeconds x failureThreshold is the time the hub gets to become ready before
the kubelet starts killing it. The schema pins each factor separately and cannot
pin the product, so both of these passed with the schema fully active:

  probes.startup.periodSeconds=1   -> 60 x 1s  = 60s, not 300s
  probes.startup.enabled=false     -> no startupProbe at all

Both rendered clean and passed kubeconform -strict, while the schema's own
description stated the safety property as though it were enforced. A guard whose
stated contract is wider than what it enforces is worse than no guard, because it
stops the reader thinking: an operator lowering periodSeconds for faster
readiness detection reads "at least 60", sees failureThreshold: 60 untouched, and
has cut the first-boot budget by 80% with nothing to tell them.

WHY 300 SECONDS. THE HARM HAS TWO HALVES AND ONLY ONE OF THEM IS PRESENT-TENSE ON
THIS CHART. Each is written in its own tense, because an earlier version of this
paragraph gave the Cloud SQL half as the live justification and the round-4
axis-(d) sweep caught it: the number was being defended by a mechanism this chart
never reaches.

  PRESENT TENSE, ON THIS CHART, TODAY - THE ORDERED SEQUENCE. First boot runs a
  sequence of schema and data migration steps before the listener binds, and a
  kill lands BETWEEN two of them. "Partially applied" is not an inference from the
  word migration: CompositeStore.Migrate (pkg/store/entadapter/composite.go:179-227)
  is a null-scope_id backfill, a dedup, entc.AutoMigrate, an allowlist-to-invited
  data migration, a verification-status backfill and a seed, with in-source
  comments at :180-184 and :202-205 stating that the order matters and why. The
  retry then starts from a different state than the attempt before it, and the
  failure stops being reproducible. THIS HALF RUNS ON SQLITE: migrateStore
  (cmd/server_foreground.go:1168-1170) returns s.Migrate(ctx) directly for every
  driver that is not postgres, and this chart's driver IS sqlite - it renders no
  --db, so the default at pkg/config/hub_config.go:540 stands.

  THE CLOUD SQL PHASE, NOT THIS ONE - THE BLOCKING LOCK. pg_advisory_lock is not
  taken here and cannot be. The postgres branch of migrateStore is its only
  caller, pkg/provision/provision.go's Locker is documented as "on SQLite it's a
  no-op (single-writer serializes already)", and composite.go:221-223 says the
  same thing from the other side. When the Cloud SQL values land the lock becomes
  real, the wait becomes unbounded in the way a lock is unbounded, and 300s stops
  being a margin and starts being a bound. RE-DERIVE IT THERE.

  This is the same treatment updateStrategyType gets below, for the same reason: a
  harm that arrives with a later phase is written in that phase's tense, or it is
  read as a present-tense claim and audited as false.

SO WHAT IS THE 300 ITSELF? A MARGIN, NOT A MEASUREMENT, and it says so rather than
being left to look like one. Nothing in this tree derives 300s from a timed SQLite
migration, and on an empty SQLite database the sequence above is fast. The number
is sized for the case the chart is being built toward - a first boot against a
cold Cloud SQL instance, behind that lock - and it costs the SQLite case nothing,
because a healthy hub passes the startup probe on the first or second check and
never approaches the budget. What the guard buys today is that nobody shrinks the
budget quietly while the phases that will need it are still being added.

DISABLING THE STARTUP PROBE IS PERMITTED ONLY WHILE THE LIVENESS PROBE IS OFF,
which is a real distinction and not a loophole. A startup probe's job is to hold
the liveness probe off until the container is up. With liveness disabled - the
default - nothing can kill the pod during the migration; readiness simply stays
false and the pod stays out of the Service, which is correct. With liveness
enabled and no startup probe, the liveness probe begins immediately and kills the
hub mid-migration, which is the exact failure the budget exists to prevent.

First boot runs an ordered sequence of schema and data migration steps before the listener binds (CompositeStore.Migrate), so a pod killed part-way through leaves a partially applied migration and the retry starts from a different state than this attempt did. The 300s itself is a margin rather than a measurement: it is sized for a first boot against Cloud SQL behind the schema-migration advisory lock, which a later phase adds.

{{/*
Deployment update strategy: Recreate at one replica, RollingUpdate above it.

A DEFAULT MAY ENCODE A PREFERENCE; A REFUSAL MUST ENCODE A HARM. This helper is
the record of that distinction, because it briefly got it wrong.

The default is a preference and owes nobody a justification: at one replica
Recreate is the simpler upgrade, and it is what VALIDATION.md scenario 20 is
written against (a short outage, with PTY sessions, port tunnels and in-memory
presence lost). An operator who would rather keep those across an upgrade sets
RollingUpdate and accepts a window with two pods. That is an ordinary Kubernetes
trade and the chart takes no position on it.

There WAS a fail here refusing explicit RollingUpdate at replicaCount 1, added
during round-2 review and removed in round 3. It is worth knowing why, because
the mechanism was sound and only the justification was invented:

  - THE SUBJECT IS WHAT THIS CHART RENDERS, NOT WHAT THE PROJECT IS BUILDING
    TOWARD. Every wrong answer below came from substituting the second for the
    first. What it renders now: an emptyDir at the hub's state directory, a
    read-only settings.yaml projected into it, and no --db on argv. Both volumes
    are pod-local and one of them cannot be written, so REPLICAS STILL SHARE NO
    MUTABLE STATE - which is the property the argument below actually needs.
  - isHADeployment IS TRUE HERE AND WAS FALSE AT PHASE 0, BY TWO INDEPENDENT
    ROUTES. This bullet used to say the chart mounted no volumes and that
    isHADeployment (cmd/server_foreground.go:927) was false at every replica
    count. Both halves were true while the chart rendered no settings file. Now
    a rendered server.database.driver of postgres satisfies the test at :931,
    and server.storage.provider gcs together with server.auth.mode proxy
    satisfies the one at :934. GKE does not set K_SERVICE, but hub.extraEnv can
    and it renders - measured - so that route is reachable from this chart too,
    and assertHAUnlanded transcribes all three rather than two.
    hostedHAGuardsRequired (:921) is therefore satisfied and
    the hosted HA preflight DOES run - which is why this chart renders the five
    Block-1 keys in both auth modes rather than leaving them to the hub.
  - The stated harm - "two hubs writing the same RWX workspace share" - is still
    not a thing this chart can produce, and the reason is now narrower than "no
    volumes". It is that the share itself does not exist: no RWX volume, no
    workspace_storage section, nothing two pods can both write.
  - The replacement harm - "the upgrade transiently enters HA mode" - has to be
    stated more carefully than it was. HA DETECTION is on, at one replica and at
    ten, so "it is off" is no longer the answer. The answer is that entering the
    hub's HA mode costs nothing here, because every consequence of it is about
    shared mutable state and there is none to share. The refusal was wrong for
    the reason above, not for this one.
  - LATER PHASES CHANGE THIS AGAIN, WHICH IS WHY IT IS WRITTEN DOWN RATHER THAN
    LEFT AS AN ABSENCE. Cloud SQL supplies the database URL behind the postgres
    driver this chart already renders; the workspace-share phase lands the RWX
    volume.
    Concurrency correctness becomes a live question at that point, and it is
    answered there by Postgres advisory locks (pg_try_advisory_lock,
    pkg/provision/provision.go:109-116, "for cross-node mutual exclusion", and
    the blocking pg_advisory_lock in migrateStore at
    cmd/server_foreground.go:1168-1200) - by the hub, not by this chart. If a
    refusal is ever warranted here, it will be warranted then, and it will need
    a harm found in that tree.
  - And no third candidate can rescue it, without anyone having to look for
    one. The refusal triggered only when replicaCount <= 1. Any harm from
    CONCURRENCY is strictly worse at two replicas - permanent instead of
    bounded by one startup - and the chart accepts two replicas without a word.
    A refusal whose trigger is "only one replica" cannot be discriminating on
    concurrency, whatever the harm turns out to be.
  - On the one axis where concurrency IS documented to cost something - more
    than one replica breaks the web terminal and exec for (N-1)/N of requests,
    see replicaCount in values.yaml - the refusal was backwards: it forced
    Recreate, which loses every session with certainty.

The shape that found it is still a good heuristic and it is still worth running:
an enum on one field, a minimum on another, and the property about the pair. It
is how probes.startup's budget was found, and that one was real. But the shape
tells you where to LOOK. The harm has to be found in source before anything is
refused, and that is the half all three of us skipped here. Recorded in
verification/p0-product-invariant-sweep.md as a benign shape-match, next to the
instance that was not.

Assert that a flag or variable NAME does not announce credential material.

Call as:
  {{- include "scion-hub.assertNoCredentialName" (dict "name" $n "source" "hub.args flag") }}

THIS IS NOT REDUNDANT WITH THE VALUE CHECK BELOW, and the next person to read
both will suspect that it is. It is not, for one reason: a credential value is
not distinguishable by inspection. --admin-token=hunter2 is caught here and
cannot be caught there, because "hunter2" has no shape - no scheme, no prefix,
nothing to match on. It is an ordinary word. The value axis reads what the value
looks like; the name axis reads what the operator called it, and when the value
is unremarkable the name is the only signal left.

This is not hypothetical. An earlier revision of this guard dropped the name
axis in favour of value shapes, on the reasoning that names are what produce
false positives. That regressed exactly this case, and it did so while looking
like a security improvement. Do not remove either axis.

The rule is position, not substring, and the distinction is the whole reason this
is not a naive contains-check. A credential noun at the END of a flag name says
what the value IS: --admin-token, --api-key, --session-secret, --gh-pat. The same
noun at the START says what the flag is ABOUT, and the value is then a duration,
a count or a project name: --token-ttl, --secret-manager-project. A plural is
also about, not is: --max-tokens is a limit.

So this matches a credential noun only as a whole trailing segment, or as the
entire name. Substring matching was tried first and rejected: it fired on
--max-tokens, --token-ttl and --secret-manager-project, and because hub.args is
append-only with no override, a false positive there is unusable rather than
merely annoying.

THE SEGMENT SEPARATOR IS THE HYPHEN, AND A CALLER WHOSE NAMES USE ANY OTHER
SEPARATOR MUST TRANSLATE BEFORE CALLING. That is argv semantics and it is
deliberate; it is also a trap, because environment variable names separate with
underscores. Passed SESSION_SECRET unchanged, the pattern above matches nothing:
it needs a hyphen or start-of-string before "secret", and "session_secret"
offers neither. The guard would render, appear in the diff, read as applied, and
catch precisely the value it was added for. A reviewer asking "is this guard
correct" finds a correct guard; the question that finds this is "is it reachable
in the state it guards against".

So the underscore check below is not input validation, it is the reachability
check, and it fails loudly rather than letting the caller proceed with an inert
guard. Translate at the call site - "_" to "-" - and call this unchanged. The
alternative, widening the class to (^|[-_]), was rejected: the hyphen rule is
correct for argv, and the caller with the other convention is the one that
should adapt. Do one or the other, never both.

An underscore in a flag name is also a real error on the argv path: no flag on
`server start` uses one, so pflag would reject it and the hub would crash-loop.
Failing here says so at render time.

Assert that a single value does not look like credential material.

Call as:
  {{- include "scion-hub.assertNoCredential" (dict "value" $v "source" "hub.args entry") }}

It renders nothing and fails the render when the value matches. Defined once and
shared, so every place in this chart that puts an operator-supplied value
somewhere world-readable - argv today, environment values later - applies the
same test rather than each growing its own near-miss version of it.

It inspects the VALUE, not the name of the thing holding it. Name-based checks
miss the case that actually occurs: postgres://scion:hunter2@10.0.0.1/scion
carries a password and contains none of the words a name pattern would look for.
A name-based check is still worth having, but it is a different axis and belongs
with whatever owns the name.

What it catches: credentials in URL userinfo, credentials in a URL query string
under a well-known parameter name, and a handful of well-known credential
prefixes. What it does NOT catch, and cannot: an opaque high-entropy string with
no recognisable shape. There is no reliable way to tell one of those from a
legitimate identifier, and a heuristic that guessed would reject real values with
no override, which for an append-only list is worse than the hole. Do not add an
entropy heuristic here.

THE USERNAME IN THE USERINFO PATTERN IS OPTIONAL, and that is not a typo. An
empty username is the standard form for a Redis URL and is valid for Postgres,
so redis://:hunter2@10.0.0.1:6379 carries a real password. Requiring one
username character missed it - the same class as the DSN case the name axis
cannot see, since the flag holding it can be called anything.

THE PEM ALTERNATIVE IS UNREACHABLE THROUGH hub.args, and live for every other
caller. Every PEM header contains spaces and starts with a dash, so on the argv
path the whitespace guard in scion-hub.hubArgs always rejects it first. Do not
conclude the branch is dead and delete it: it is the branch that catches a
multi-line private key in an environment value, where whitespace is legal, and
its only test coverage chart-wide lives with those callers rather than here. If
you change this alternative, that is the test that will tell you.

The matched value is redacted or truncated in the failure message. A guard whose
error message prints the secret it just caught has moved the secret from argv
into CI logs.

{{/*
The hub command line.

--hosted and --host 0.0.0.0 are rendered unconditionally and no value can remove
them. Without hosted mode the server applies workstation defaults, derives
auth-enabled from a development flag and forces its bind address to 127.0.0.1,
which behind a load balancer is unreachable and unauthenticated by accident.

--production is deliberately not emitted: it is a deprecated alias of --hosted.

hub.args appends to this list and can never replace it. Two guards apply to
anything appended.

PFLAG IS LAST-WINS, which is the premise the whole reserved list rests on.
Appending a flag the chart already rendered does not conflict, error or warn -
it silently replaces the chart's value. So "the chart renders it" is not
protection; the reserved list is the protection.

THE FLAG SET IS cmd/server.go PLUS cmd/root.go. server start inherits rootCmd's
PERSISTENT flags, so the flags it accepts are not all declared in the file that
declares the command. Two rounds of this list were built from cmd/server.go
alone and both were incomplete in the same direction: --global, --project, -g
and --grove are all inherited, all accepted by server start, and all absent from
cmd/server.go. If you extend this list, enumerate both files.

The RESERVED flags are grouped by WHY they are reserved, in five lists below,
and the grouping is load-bearing rather than tidy. Only one group is verifiable
against the rendered arguments. For the other four, finding no match in the
rendered arguments is the expected steady state and NOT evidence that the entry
is stale - which is exactly the reasoning that would delete them. A flat list
under one comment invites the next maintainer to verify each entry against what
the chart renders, conclude that --config was added in error, and remove it;
that removal would look like tidying and would reopen the largest hole in this
guard. The failure messages differ per group so the reason is visible at the
point it fires, to the person arguing with the guard rather than only to the
person reading this file.

SHORTHANDS MUST BE LISTED BY LETTER. The normalisation below reduces -x and --x
to the same token, so a shorthand is only caught if its letter is on the list.
"c" is on it for --config and "g" for --project; those are the two shorthands
that matter today. Any future flag registered with a *VarP form needs its letter
added here.

CASE IS NORMALISED before the lists are consulted. pflag itself is
case-sensitive, so --CONFIG would not reach the hub as --config; it would be an
unknown flag and the hub would crash-loop. Rejecting it here turns that
crash-loop into a render error, which is the same reasoning as the whitespace
guards below.

The CREDENTIAL check is scion-hub.assertNoCredential, applied to every rendered
argument. It looks at values rather than flag names - see its own comment for
why, and for what it deliberately does not catch. It replaced a substring match
for "secret", "password" and "token" anywhere in the argument, which both missed
the real case (a DSN) and rejected legitimate flags such as --max-tokens with no
way to override; names are handled by the exact-match reserved list instead.

2. NOTHING may pass these. Not the operator, and not a future phase of this
   chart either. Each of them touches how the hub's configuration or its project
   context is selected - and NOT, as this comment claimed for three rounds, by
   redirecting where the configuration is read from.

   THAT HEADER WAS WRONG ABOUT THE MECHANISM FOR EVERY MEMBER OF THIS LIST, and
   "imprecise" would be the wrong word for it: the model it gave the reader was
   false and has to be removed rather than softened. config.GetGlobalDir()
   (pkg/config/paths.go:188-193) is os.UserHomeDir() joined with a constant. IT
   TAKES NO ARGUMENTS. There is no flag input on this command that can move the
   global configuration directory - not --config, not --project, not --profile,
   not --global. Anyone re-deriving this list should start there, because it
   disposes of the whole family in four lines.

   The reservations stand. Each now carries the reason that is actually true of
   it, and the reasons differ, so they are given per entry.

   DO NOT REMOVE THESE BECAUSE THE CHART DOES NOT SET THEM. That is the point of
   them, not evidence that they were added by mistake. There is no legitimate
   reason for this chart to emit any of them, so "nothing in the rendered args
   matches this entry" is the expected steady state forever.

   --config AND -c: READ THIS BEFORE YOU CHANGE OR CHECK IT. It reaches exactly
   one place on this command's path: config.LoadGlobalConfig(serverConfigPath),
   cmd/server_foreground.go:827, via cmd/server.go:237.

   THE STATE OF THIS FLAG, IN THE ONLY FORM THAT STAYS TRUE:

     LIVE   while the GLOBAL settings document has no non-nil top-level server:
            key. That is Phase 0, this commit.
     INERT  from the moment it has one. That is what the configuration phase is
            for.
     RESERVED IN BOTH STATES, which is the whole reason this entry is written as
            a state machine rather than as a description.

   READ THIS PARAGRAPH AND YOU MAY STOP: WHY THE ENTRY DOES NOT DEPEND ON ANY OF
   THE MECHANISM BELOW. Five separate readings of this flag have been asserted
   confidently and wrongly in a single day, and the reservation was correct under
   every one of them, because A RESERVED FLAG REFUSES THE FLAG INSTEAD OF
   REASONING ABOUT ITS EFFECT. Everything after this paragraph is an explanation;
   none of it is load-bearing for the refusal. That is deliberate, and it is the
   answer to the maintainer who audits this list by auditing effects: you will
   keep finding the effect description imperfect, and THE ENTRY DOES NOT REST ON
   THE EFFECT DESCRIPTION. It also covers a moving target - a mitigation scoped to
   "prevent redirection" does not cover an overlay, and one scoped to "prevent an
   overlay" does not cover a sole-source substitution, and this flag does two of
   those three depending on which loader is reached.

   THE TRANSITION IS THE server: KEY. NOT THE EXISTENCE OF A FILE, NOT WHO WROTE
   THE FILE, NOT WHETHER THIS CHART MOUNTS ONE. Three separate corrections
   collapsed into that one sentence and each of them was a confident wrong answer
   first, so the reasons are worth keeping:

     - loadServerFromSettingsFile (pkg/config/hub_config.go:1331-1347) reads the
       file and then tests raw["server"] for present AND NON-NIL. It never asks
       whether the file exists as a separate question, and "server: ~" parses,
       has the key, and is still not found.
     - THE GLOBAL settings.yaml IS THIS CHART'S, AND IT CARRIES A server KEY.
       That is the whole transition, and it is why the flag is inert here rather
       than merely discouraged. The chart mounts an emptyDir at $HOME/.scion and
       lands its rendered settings.yaml into it as a subPath, so the file
       GetGlobalDir() resolves to is the file this chart wrote.
     - THE HUB DOES NOT SEED ONE OVER THE TOP, AND THE REASON IS THE MOUNT. The
       seeding call is guarded at cmd/server_foreground.go:104 by
       os.Stat(globalDir) / os.IsNotExist, so config.InitGlobal (:107) fires only
       when $HOME/.scion is ABSENT. The emptyDir makes the directory exist before
       the process starts, so the guard takes the else branch and the embedded
       defaults in pkg/config/embeds/default_settings.yaml - schema_version,
       active_profile, default_template, default_harness_config, image_registry,
       cli, runtimes, profiles, AND NO server KEY - are never materialised. The
       rendered file is the only settings.yaml in the container.
     - THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH WAS RIGHT FOR A REASON THAT NO LONGER APPLIES, and
       it is kept here because the reasoning is what a later phase needs. At
       phase 0 the chart delivered no ConfigMap and no Secret, the directory did
       not exist, InitGlobal fired, and the seeded file had no server key - so
       the flag was LIVE, by a different route to a different answer. Anything
       that changes what is at $HOME/.scion changes which of these two paragraphs
       applies: mounting a volume with no settings.yaml in it puts the flag back
       to LIVE, and nothing in the render inspects that.

   THREE VALUES, NOT TWO. Reading the flag as binary is what produced two of the
   wrong answers above. In order of evaluation:

     :647  The GLOBAL settings.yaml is read FIRST and unconditionally. A non-nil
           server key here wins and the --config path is NEVER READ. This is the
           Phase 1 state.

     :648-659  ROUTE A - SOLE-SOURCE SUBSTITUTION, and it is NOT an overlay. When
           the global read finds nothing, and --config is set and stat-able, the
           DIRECTORY of the --config path is searched for a settings.yaml, and a
           non-nil server key found there is returned as the server config, built
           from that file ALONE (ConvertV1ServerToGlobalConfig, :1360). This is
           what an operator pointing --config at a directory actually hits, and it
           fires BEFORE the overlay below.

           A detail of route A worth its own sentence, because it is the kind that
           produces an unfalsifiable bug report: IT DOES NOT READ THE FILE THE
           OPERATOR NAMED. :651-656 stats the path and takes filepath.Dir of it
           when it is not a directory, then appends settings.yaml. So
           --config /etc/scion/myserver.yaml reads /etc/scion/settings.yaml, a
           file the operator never mentioned, and ignores the one they did.

     :699, :772-788  ROUTE B - THE OVERLAY, reached only when route A also finds
           nothing. loadGlobalConfigLegacy loads embedded defaults, then the
           global ~/.scion/server.yaml (:773-775), then LAYERS the --config path
           on top (:778-787). Here a directory means server.yaml or server.yml
           (loadServerConfigFile, :1314-1322) while a file is loaded verbatim
           (:785) - so THE SAME FLAG VALUE SELECTS A DIFFERENT FILENAME IN ROUTE A
           THAN IN ROUTE B.

   Bigger than an overlay, smaller than "the whole configuration load moves",
   which is what this comment claimed for three rounds.

   AND IT GOES INERT IN COMPLETE SILENCE, WHICH IS THE REASON A RESERVED FLAG IS
   THE ONLY GUARD AVAILABLE. There is no deprecation warning on --config and no
   log line of any kind. --config is a plain StringVarP at cmd/server.go:237 and
   carries no MarkDeprecated anywhere. Exactly two flags reachable on server start
   do carry one: "production", marked on serverStartCmd itself at cmd/server.go:236,
   and "grove", marked on rootCmd's PERSISTENT flags at cmd/root.go:251 and so
   inherited here. An earlier version of this sentence read "MarkDeprecated on
   server start covers only production (cmd/server.go:236, :290)" and was wrong
   twice in one clause - it missed the inherited --grove, and :290 is that same
   mark on serverInstallCmd, a DIFFERENT COMMAND, offered as though it were a
   second site on this one. Neither error touches the conclusion about --config,
   which is exactly why it survived three readings: A CITATION THAT FAILS IN A
   PLAUSIBLE WAY IS WORSE THAN ONE THAT FAILS OBVIOUSLY. The
   only two warnings anywhere on this path (pkg/config/hub_config.go:668 and
   :678) fire on server.yaml coexisting with settings.yaml and are not about
   --config at all. An earlier version of this comment claimed a deprecation
   warning; it does not exist, and "accepted and silently ignored" is a worse
   defect than "redirects", not a milder one - a redirect is at least detectable
   by its effects.

   THE ONE FEEDBACK PATH THE FLAG CAN PRODUCE IS WORSE THAN SILENCE. Point
   --config at a directory that also holds a server.yaml and :678 prints "Both
   settings.yaml (server key) and server.yaml exist in <their directory>. Using
   settings.yaml." - naming THEIR directory while the settings.yaml actually in
   force is the global one. The only diagnostic available reads as confirmation
   that their file was loaded.

   THE STATE IS A PROPERTY OF THE DEPLOYED CONFIGURATION, NOT OF THE BINARY, which
   is why the reservation outlives every reading of the flag: any phase can move it
   between LIVE and INERT without touching this file, this list, or cmd/. A
   reservation is the only form of this knowledge that survives that move, because
   it does not depend on which state is current.

   WHAT THE INERT HALF REQUIRES OF THE CONFIGURATION PHASE - stated here as a
   requirement, not as an observation of code that exists at this commit: the
   GLOBAL settings document must carry a top-level server: key that is a MAP.
   Nesting it under a profile, renaming it, splitting it across two files, or
   emitting it as an empty key all leave --config LIVE while this comment would say
   inert. That is the failure this entry cannot catch for you, because by then the
   flag is refused at render time and the settings file is wrong in a way no render
   inspects.

   FIVE READINGS OF THIS FLAG HAVE BEEN ASSERTED CONFIDENTLY AND WRONGLY, ALL IN
   ONE DAY: "redirects the entire configuration load"; "no-ops with a deprecation
   warning"; "the chart mounts nothing, so no settings file exists"; "the hub
   creates one on every boot"; and "it overlays" - each an improvement on the last
   and each still wrong. THE SHAPE THEY SHARE IS WHY THEY SURVIVED: every one of
   them reaches the correct conclusion, that the flag must be refused, so checking
   the conclusion returns "yes" and confirms the reason on the way past.
   AGREEMENT ON A CONCLUSION IS NOT CORROBORATION OF ITS REASON. If you are about
   to correct this paragraph a sixth time, compare derivations with whoever you
   agree with, not answers - that is the only comparison that has ever caught one
   of these.

   --project, -g, --grove, --profile and -p: THE REASON HERE IS DIFFERENT AND
   WEAKER THAN THE ONE THIS COMMENT USED TO GIVE, and it is written out rather
   than borrowed from --config because borrowing it is what made it wrong. They
   are declared in cmd/root.go as PERSISTENT flags, which is why three
   enumerations of cmd/server.go missed them.

   What they do NOT do: move the global configuration directory, or reach
   LoadGlobalConfig - the loader every paragraph above is about - at any point.
   The hub's server configuration is not reachable from any of them.

   What --project/-g/--grove DO do on this command, traced from the flag
   declaration outward: they set projectPath (cmd/root.go:249-250 - :248 is
   rootCmd.Long, not a flag declaration), and
   PersistentPreRunE passes projectPath to config.LoadSettings at cmd/root.go:123
   and config.LoadEffectiveSettings at :129 for EVERY command, server start
   included. Those two select which project's settings.yaml supplies cli.autohelp
   and cli.interactive_disabled, and the second can force the process
   non-interactive. It also reaches printDevAuthWarningIfNeeded (:187), which
   loads the same file again to decide whether to warn. That is a narrower effect
   than this comment used to claim - CLI-level settings, not the hub's server
   config - but it is a real one, it is configuration selection, and the chart's
   guarantee is over the whole rendered command line. The project-required check
   at :117 is NOT among them: :106-108 clears requiresProject for the server
   subtree.

   --grove binds the SAME VARIABLE as --project (cmd/root.go:249-250), so
   reserving one without the other leaves the alias open - the hosted/production
   pattern again. It is also MarkHidden, so it will not appear in --help to
   whoever checks.

   --profile/-p IS THE WEAK ENTRY AND IS LABELLED AS ONE. Its only consumer on
   this path is config.RequireImageRegistry at cmd/root.go:181, and that call is
   skipped for the server subtree at :168-170; LoadSettings does not take it.
   Every other consumer of the variable is a client subcommand. So it is INERT on
   server start today and I could find no harm for it - by axis (d), that is the
   same answer that removed the updateStrategy refusal. It survives here on the
   one ground that differs: a reserved flag costs an operator nothing they have
   any reason to want, whereas the updateStrategy refusal blocked a configuration
   operators do want. If you disagree, MOVE IT, DO NOT DELETE IT, and name the
   list it lands in - $aliasOrIgnored is where an inert-but-plausible flag goes,
   which is where --port sits for the same reason.

   THE TRIGGER THAT WOULD MAKE --profile/-p A STRONG ENTRY, named here so nobody
   has to re-derive the weakness to find out whether it still holds: any phase
   that adds a profile-aware consumer to the SERVER path, or that passes profile
   into config.LoadSettings or config.LoadEffectiveSettings. Either one turns this
   into an ordinary $neverPassed entry with the same reason as --project, and this
   paragraph should then be deleted rather than softened. Until one of them
   happens the entry is weak and is to be described as weak.

   Note that --global is NOT here. The chart renders it, so it is in $setByChart,
   which rejects it just as absolutely. Its hazard is its own and is not the
   --config hazard by another route, which is what this comment used to claim:
   --global makes the server chdir to $HOME so it operates from the global project
   context (cmd/server_foreground.go:120-130), so --global=false leaves the hub
   running from the container's working directory instead. It does not move
   $HOME/.scion, because nothing does.

3. Not the lever they appear to be. Each of these is a flag an operator could
   reasonably reach for, which either aliases something the chart controls or is
   silently ignored in the configuration this chart renders. NOT verifiable
   against the rendered args - the chart emits neither - and that is why they are
   not in $setByChart, whose comment would instruct their deletion.

   Per-entry, because the two are here for different failures:

   --production binds the SAME VARIABLE as --hosted (cmd/server.go:235, a
   deprecated alias). So --production=false disables hosted mode - the first
   hazard this guard was ever written for - while the operator believes they
   passed a no-op about a deprecated spelling.

   --port is the hub API port for standalone mode and is IGNORED whenever
   --enable-web is set (cmd/server.go:241), which this chart always sets. An
   operator moving the port with it changes nothing at all: the listener stays on
   --web-port, the probes still pass, and the flag they set has no effect they can
   observe. A silent no-op that looks like a change is worth a render error.

4. THESE ARE DELIVERED THROUGH A CHANNEL OTHER THAN argv, AND argv WINS OVER IT
   SILENTLY. Two of the five are delivered by this chart and three are not, and
   that split is the paragraph. It was one claim about five flags until the
   settings rendering landed, and it is two claims now.

   DELIVERED HERE. argv is a second source for these today:

     base-url        SCION_SERVER_BASE_URL, templates/configmap-env.yaml:57,
                     reaching the container by envFrom at
                     templates/deployment.yaml:147-148.
     storage-bucket  server.storage.bucket in the rendered settings.yaml.

   NOT DELIVERED HERE. Live on argv, nothing to disagree with, would simply take
   effect if passed:

     db              cfg.Database.URL, cmd/server_foreground.go:875-877.
                     Arrives with Cloud SQL.
     storage-dir     cfg.Storage.LocalPath, cmd/server_foreground.go:890-892.
                     Arrives with the workspace share.
     admin-emails    cfg.Hub.AdminEmails, cmd/server_foreground.go:1402-1409 and
                     :2116-2124. Both sites read argv first and consult the
                     settings file only when argv is empty. No phase claims it.

   THIS HEADER WAS CORRECT AND STOPPED BEING CORRECT WITHOUT THE FILE BEING
   EDITED. It read "there is no second source yet for anything to disagree with"
   and "none of them lands anywhere", which were true while the chart rendered no
   ConfigMap, no Secret and no volumes, and false the moment it rendered all
   three. The refusal at the bottom of this file went stale in the same instant
   and for the same reason, which is why they are fixed together: this header is
   that refusal's justification, and fixing one alone leaves the file arguing
   with itself. An unchanged file is not evidence that its claims about the rest
   of the chart still hold - it is how they go stale unnoticed.

   ALL FIVE STAY RESERVED, AND NOT BY INERTIA. Before removing an entry, name
   where it lands instead. For base-url and storage-bucket that is the first list
   above, and the answer is still not argv. For the other three it is nowhere
   yet. None of the five is rendered as an argument ($setByChart), none selects
   which configuration is loaded ($neverPassed), none is inert or misnamed
   ($aliasOrIgnored), and none weakens authentication ($unsafeToPass).

   The harm is present for the first list and scheduled for the second. Passing
   -base-url or -storage-bucket today makes argv the silent winner over a value
   this chart rendered, and nothing logs the disagreement. Passing one of the
   other three today changes a setting nothing else sets; the same silent
   overriding starts the day its channel lands, with no edit here to mark it. The
   asymmetry is what decides it - reserving costs an operator a flag they have no
   reason to want, un-reserving is a deliberate act with a place to record itself
   (see the closing paragraph), and reserving after the fact requires somebody to
   notice.

   Not verifiable against the rendered arguments, by construction - the rendered
   argument list is where these must NOT appear. Check them against the channel,
   which hack/verify.sh now does: it asserts the first list against the render and
   the second against its absence, so moving an entry between the two lists
   without moving the code, or the reverse, is a red test rather than a paragraph
   nobody re-reads.

   NAME THE CHANNEL WHEN YOU ADD AN ENTRY, because it is not the same channel for
   every entry and the precedence differs. admin-emails, db, storage-bucket and
   storage-dir belong to the settings file; base-url belongs to the
   SCION_SERVER_BASE_URL environment variable.

   Precedence for base-url, read from the hub rather than assumed, because "two
   sources" only matters if one of them silently loses:

     cmd/server_foreground.go:2102 (initWebServer, the OAuth redirect base)
       --base-url, else SCION_SERVER_BASE_URL, else http://localhost:<web-port>
     cmd/server_foreground.go:1310 (resolveHubEndpoint, the URL agents dial)
       settings file server.hub.public_url, else --base-url, else
       SCION_SERVER_BASE_URL, else project settings, else localhost

   Two consequences, both silent. ARGV BEATS THE ENVIRONMENT AT BOTH SITES, and
   the environment variable is one this chart renders, so an argv --base-url
   shadows a live value rather than a hypothetical one, with no error and, unless
   --debug is on, no log line either. And the two sites do not
   agree with each other - the settings file outranks argv when resolving the
   agent-facing endpoint but is not consulted at all for the OAuth redirect - so
   argv plus a settings file that sets public_url yields two different base URLs
   in one process, each correct by its own rule.

   That is why this entry is reserved rather than merely discouraged. A later
   phase may still choose argv as the delivery channel for base-url, and this
   list is where it says so: move the entry, do not add a second emitter beside
   the existing one. --config is the one flag that CANNOT be promoted this way,
   which is why it sits in $neverPassed instead: the condition under which
   --config stops being read is a non-nil top-level server: key in the global
   settings document, and that key is exactly what the configuration phase
   delivers (see the $neverPassed comment). Choosing --config as a delivery
   channel would disable it.

5. These weaken authentication or place credentials where they can be read.

   ALL FOUR ARE LIVE AT THIS HEAD. Unlike $ownedByConfig above, nothing here is

   --session-secret (cmd/server.go:275) is the signing key for the web session
   cookie store and the hub's JWT signing keys. Two harms, not one. It is a
   credential on argv, readable by anyone who can read the pod spec - which the
   credential guard below would also catch, but only if the operator's value
   happens to look like a credential, and a passphrase does not. And it PRE-EMPTS
   the delivery channel: resolveSessionSecret (cmd/server_foreground.go:1452-1456)
   takes the flag first and only falls back to SCION_SERVER_SESSION_SECRET, so an
   argv value silently outranks the Secret-backed environment variable the
   session-secret phase mounts. THAT CHANNEL IS NOT THE SECRET THIS CHART ALREADY
   RENDERS, and the distinction is worth the sentence: this chart renders a Secret
   holding settings.yaml, and the settings file has no session-secret key at all:
   there is no such field anywhere in V1ServerConfig, and resolveSessionSecret
   reads exactly three sources in order - the flag, SCION_SERVER_SESSION_SECRET,
   then bare SESSION_SECRET for compatibility - none of which is a file. So the
   presence of a Secret in the rendered output says nothing about
   this claim, which stays forward-tensed until SCION_SERVER_SESSION_SECRET is
   emitted. Measured at this head: zero occurrences of SESSION_SECRET in every
   permutation's render.

   --dev-auth (cmd/server.go:251) IS A DIRECT WRITE TO cfg.Auth.Enabled AT
   cmd/server_foreground.go:884-886, AND THE DANGEROUS DIRECTION IS TRUE, NOT
   FALSE. Worth stating explicitly because the natural reading is backwards. The
   workstation defaults that would turn dev auth on (applyWorkstationDefaults,
   cmd/server_config.go:35-37, and the assignment at server_foreground.go:843) are
   BOTH inside an if !hostedMode block, and this chart renders --hosted, so they
   do not run: cfg.Auth.Enabled is false here and --dev-auth=false merely restates
   the default. Passing --dev-auth (or =true) is what changes something - it
   satisfies the gate at :212 and initialises dev-token authentication in a hosted
   deployment, standing an auto-generated static token up beside the real identity
   path. That one is not silent (:216-217 logs a warning in hosted mode), but a
   warning in a log nobody reads is not a control, and a render error is.

   --enable-test-login (cmd/server.go:252) is wired to the web server at
   cmd/server_foreground.go:2163 and registers POST /api/v1/auth/test-login
   (pkg/hub/web.go:747). The route is always mounted and the flag is the gate:
   pkg/hub/handlers_test_login.go:52-55 returns 403 unless it is set, after which
   the handler mints a user session behind a challenge token rather than the
   configured identity provider. Also warned about at :2167-2168, and the same
   answer applies.

   --web-assets-dir (cmd/server.go:274) replaces the embedded web UI with a
   directory served straight off the container filesystem: pkg/hub/web.go:497
   stores it and :832-833 hands it to http.FileServer(http.Dir(...)). It is here
   rather than in $ownedByConfig because the hazard is not a second source for a
   value - it is that the served asset tree stops being the audited one that was
   built into the image.

ADJUDICATED AND DELIBERATELY NOT RESERVED. The five lists above say what is

than as one blanket sentence, because a blanket sentence is what would survive a
change that falsified it.

  --no-auto-migrate (cmd/server.go:244). RAISED AS THE ONE MOST LIKELY TO
    INTERACT WITH THE STARTUP BUDGET. IT DOES NOT, and that is the finding, not
    an absence of one: it gates only the in-process upgrade of a LEGACY raw-SQL
    hub.db to the Ent schema (cmd/server_foreground.go:1263-1266, which errors out
    when it finds one and the flag is set). CompositeStore.Migrate - the ordered
    sequence assertStartupBudget is written against - is not behind it and runs
    either way. A fresh GKE pod has no legacy hub.db, so the flag is inert here.
  --debug (cmd/server.go:255). Logging verbosity. Note it SHADOWS the persistent
    --debug at cmd/root.go:267: a local flag of the same name wins, so this sets
    enableDebug and not debugMode. Harmless either way, and recorded only so the
    duplicate is not mistaken for a finding later.
  --runtime-broker-port (cmd/server.go:248). Sets cfg.RuntimeBroker.Port
    (server_foreground.go:881-883). The chart renders --enable-runtime-broker but
    no port, exposes no broker port on the Service and points no probe at one, so
    moving it stays internally consistent inside the pod.
  --template-cache-dir, --template-cache-max (cmd/server.go:262-263). Cache
    location and size. No auth, config-selection or credential surface.
  --simulate-remote-broker (cmd/server.go:266). Test-path selector that skips
    co-located optimisations. Degrades performance, weakens nothing.

{{- /*
THE INVARIANT THAT MAKES $setByChart SELF-CHECKING, IN BOTH DIRECTIONS.

$setByChart and the flags rendered above must be the SAME SET. Two containments,
four lines, and they catch opposite mistakes:

  A. rendered is a subset of $setByChart - catches a flag the chart passes that
     nobody reserved. The list was incomplete twice this way: six flags the chart
     itself renders (foreground, enable-hub, enable-runtime-broker, enable-web,
     auto-provide, global) were missing, and because pflag is last-wins an
     operator could append --enable-runtime-broker=false and get a hub that stays
     Ready, keeps its RBAC, and can never launch an agent.

  B. $setByChart is a subset of rendered - catches a member the chart claims to
     set and does not. Two entries sat here that the chart never emitted, under
     the comment above telling the maintainer to delete entries not present in
     the rendered args: a deletion instruction pointed at two live guards, one of
     them --production, whose removal reopens disable-hosted-mode because it
     binds the same variable as --hosted. They are in $aliasOrIgnored now, and
     direction B is what keeps them out rather than the comment.

A alone was implemented first and would not have caught B's case at all. Both
mistakes are the same mistake - the list and the render drifting - and one
containment only ever sees one direction of drift.

DIRECTION B IS MEANINGFUL FOR $setByChart AND FOR NO OTHER LIST. The other three
are reserved precisely BECAUSE the chart does not render them, so for them the
empty intersection is the expected steady state forever. That is what the split
into reasons bought beyond documentation: it isolated the one group whose
membership is a checkable claim about this file, and made it checkable.

Both run against the chart's own arguments only, before hub.args is appended, so
they assert a property of THIS FILE rather than of operator input.

IF A LATER PHASE RENDERS A FLAG CONDITIONALLY, BUILD $setByChart BESIDE THE
RENDER - append to both inside the same if - rather than weakening either
containment. I had argued for keeping A one-directional on the grounds that B
would fire on a legitimate conditional flag; that was the wrong trade. It buys a
future convenience with a present hole, and the convenience is available anyway
by keeping the list and the command in step, which is the thing being asserted.

CONSIDERED AND REJECTED: deriving $setByChart from $args. It would make both
containments true by construction and delete this block, and that is precisely
the objection - DERIVING ONE SIDE OF A COMPARISON FROM THE OTHER PRODUCES A CHECK
THAT CANNOT FAIL. Both directions become tautologies over a set defined as the
thing they are compared against, and the render stays green forever whatever the
command does.

That is a different move from removing a coupling, though the two look identical
in a diff. service.port and hub.webPort need no assertion because targetPort: http
means there is no longer anything to violate - the INVARIANT is gone. Deriving
this list would leave the invariant exactly as breachable as it is now and delete
only the CHECK. Prefer the first; refuse the second.

A second and lesser objection, kept because it is independently true: the
derivation silently expands the operator-facing reserved set every time a
maintainer adds a flag to the command, which is a contract change with nothing
announcing it.

The explicit list is the statement; these two checks are what keep the statement
true.

KNOWN LIMIT OF THE SCAN BELOW: it classifies an element as a flag by a leading
"-", so a flag whose VALUE is in the next element and itself starts with "-"
would be counted as a flag of its own, and direction A would report a chart
defect naming something that is not a flag. Nothing the chart renders today
looks like that - every space-separated value is an address, a port or a path -
and the failure is loud, immediate and names the offending token, so it cannot
ship silently. THE REMEDY IF IT EVER FIRES: walk $args pairwise, remembering
whether the previous element was a flag that takes a separate value, instead of
testing each element independently. Written down rather than pre-implemented,
because the pairwise walk needs a list of which flags take values, and that list
would be a third thing to keep in step with the command.

Both are conditioned on the entry actually carrying a literal, for that reason.

THE UNDERSCORE IS WHY $name IS TRANSLATED BEFORE THE NAME CHECK.
scion-hub.assertNoCredentialName matches a credential noun as a whole trailing
SEGMENT, and its segment separator is the hyphen, because it was written for
flag names. Environment variable names separate with underscores, so passing
SESSION_SECRET to it unchanged matches nothing at all: the guard renders, reads
as applied, and is inert. Translating _ to - puts the name into the alphabet the
helper's positional rule is expressed in, and the rule then means the same thing
on both axes - SESSION_SECRET is caught, TOKEN_TTL_SECONDS and MAX_TOKENS are
not. verify.sh asserts the catch and both non-catches, so a regression here
cannot pass as "no false positives".

Do not "simplify" this by widening the shared helper's character class instead.
The translation belongs to the caller whose names use underscores; the helper is
shared with argv, where the hyphen rule is the correct one.

THE VALUES THAT REACH settings.yaml AND ONLY settings.yaml, AND WHAT THEY WRITE.
The single source for that list. NOTES.txt renders it, values.yaml repeats it in
prose at config.existingSecret, and hack/verify.sh checks all three against the
render rather than against each other.

Under config.existingSecret the chart writes no settings.yaml, so each of these
values silently does nothing and the operator's own file has to carry the key on
the right. That is the whole content of the list: what you now owe.

WHY THESE ARE DOCUMENTED AND THE THREE BELOW ARE REFUSED, WHICH IS NOT A
JUDGEMENT ABOUT WHICH MATTER MORE. It is about what a template can see. Helm
hands a template the MERGED values and no way to ask which of them the operator
actually wrote, so intent is only legible where the chart's default is empty:
config.extra, storage.bucket and agents.imageRegistry are empty by default, so a
non-empty one was typed by someone and can be refused. Every value here has a
non-empty default - auth.mode is "proxy", hub.name is "Scion Hub",
database.maxOpenConns is 25 - and a guard on truthiness would fire on a values
file that never mentioned them. There is no third option: a literal copy of the
default inside the guard is a second source of truth for the default, and it
goes stale in exactly the direction that turns the guard off.

So this list is not a weaker refusal. It is the part of the same problem that a
refusal cannot express, and it is checked to the same standard: hack/verify.sh
mutates every leaf of values.yaml, renders, and requires each value whose only
effect is on the settings document to be EITHER refused by the guard below OR
named here with the settings key its mutation actually moved. A value in neither
place fails the suite, and so does an entry here that no longer moves the key it
claims. The pairs below were produced by that probe, not written from memory.

Both columns are load-bearing. The left tells an operator which of their values
went nowhere; the right tells them what to write instead, which is the only half
they can act on, and it is not guessable from the left - hub.name becomes
server.hub.hub_name, and rbac.agentNamespace and runtime.namespace both become
the same runtimes.kubernetes.namespace.

config.existingSecret means "I supply the whole settings.yaml myself", so the
chart renders none - and every value whose only effect is on the file it did not
render becomes inert. An inert value is the same silent no-op this whole design
exists to avoid, so supplying both is an error rather than a precedence rule.

The three names below are the settings values with an empty default, which is
what makes them refusable at all; the reasoning is in the comment above the
transfer list, and the two lists are checked together as one partition of the
values tree. Later phases append their own inline values here as they are
introduced (the database password, the session secret, the OAuth client secret).

Two settings values are missing from the list on purpose and are covered anyway.
storage.provider and database.driver have non-empty defaults, so neither can be
refused on truthiness - but the only other value each can take (gcs, postgres)
is one the chart already requires storage.bucket alongside, so any render that
moves either of them is refused for the bucket. hack/verify.sh proves that by
mutation rather than by argument; if a later phase makes either reachable
without a bucket, that check goes red rather than the pair going quiet.

MUST be called from a template that always renders. Calling it only from
scion-hub.settings does not work, and does not look broken: the settings
template is reached through secret-settings.yaml, which is itself skipped when
config.existingSecret is set - so the one configuration this check exists to
reject is the one configuration in which it never runs. deployment.yaml calls

The HA acknowledgement gate.

WHAT IT IS FOR. This chart can render a configuration that satisfies the hub's
isHADeployment test (cmd/server_foreground.go:927), which turns on
validateHostedHAPreflight (:951). That preflight has thirteen gates and this
release cannot satisfy eight of them, so the hub aborts at
cmd/server_foreground.go:151-153 before it serves anything. The postgres/gcs
shape is a choice an operator can coherently have made, so this is an opt-in
acknowledgement rather than a refusal.

MEASURED, gate by gate, through config.LoadGlobalConfig and the real
validateHostedHAPreflight, on the settings.yaml this chart actually renders.
Stepped by satisfying each gate and re-running, because the preflight returns on
first failure. ci/values-settings.yaml, in order:

  1  server.database.url                        Cloud SQL phase
  2  a durable session/signing secret           session-secret phase
  3  server.auth.proxy.provider=iap             ingress/IAP phase
  4  server.auth.proxy.iap.audience             ingress/IAP phase
  5  server.auth.transport                      ingress/IAP phase
  6  server.auth.transport.mode=iap             ingress/IAP phase
  7  server.auth.transport.oidc_audience        ingress/IAP phase
  8  server.auth.transport.platform_auth_sa     ingress/IAP phase

ci/values-settings-oauth.yaml refuses at nine, the extra one being
server.auth.mode=proxy, which is not an unlanded phase - it is the operator's
own auth.mode being incompatible with HA detection. It sorts after the session
secret and before the proxy family.

EIGHT, NOT FIVE. The figure in circulation was five, from a walk that stopped at
server.auth.transport because the prober could not satisfy it. Three gates lie
past that wall and all three are real.

WHAT THIS CHART ALREADY SATISFIES, so nobody re-derives it: server.hub.hub_id,
server.database.driver=postgres, and server.storage.provider=gcs with a bucket.
Those three are why the refusal starts at the database URL rather than at gate
one.

THE ROUTE SET IS TRANSCRIBED FROM THE HUB, NOT INVENTED HERE.
cmd/server_ha_preflight_test.go:248-256 (ab0d227, branch
scion/ha-deployment-tripwire) makes this a two-way contract: a route added there
and not here makes this condition UNDER-trigger, rendering an HA config with no
acknowledgement, which cannot boot; a route removed or swapped there and not
here makes it OVER-trigger, demanding an acknowledgement for a deployment that
is not HA. All three routes are transcribed below. Grep this tree for
acknowledgeHAUnlanded to find it, as that comment instructs.

Route 1 is K_SERVICE, and it is NOT dead here. GKE does not set it, but
hub.extraEnv does - measured, it renders - so an operator can turn HA detection
on through a channel that looks unrelated to the database. The hub tests
os.Getenv("K_SERVICE") != "", so an explicit empty value is not the route; a
valueFrom is counted, because the chart cannot read it and under-triggering is
the outcome that will not boot.

Routes 2 and 3 use lower-cased comparison because the hub uses strings.EqualFold
(:931, :934), while auth.mode is compared exactly (:934) and so is compared
exactly here. The schema already enums all three to lower case, which makes the
difference unobservable today - transcribed faithfully anyway, because the
contract above is with the hub's test and not with the schema.

NOT EVALUATED UNDER config.existingSecret, and that is a real hole rather than
an oversight: the chart renders no settings.yaml in that shape, so it cannot see
the driver, the storage provider or the auth mode. Route 1 is still checked,
because extraEnv is the chart's own value either way.

The hub does not migrate settings at startup. MigrateSettingsFile has exactly
two callers: the "scion config migrate" CLI, and a lazy auto-migration inside
SetSettingValue that fires ONLY when the file has no schema_version key. So a
file that declares schema_version never migrates, and a file that omits it can
migrate at an arbitrary moment during normal operation.

That matters because settings.yaml is delivered as a subPath bind mount, and
MigrateSettingsFile replaces the file with os.Rename. Renaming over a bind mount
returns EBUSY. Every other write path to this file is soft - a warning, or a 500
to one caller, with the server continuing - so omitting schema_version is the
one way to turn a mount that merely refuses writes into a hard failure.

The top-level server: key, and it carries a load-bearing property that nothing
else in this file would suggest.

It is not only that the hub's configuration lives under it. It is that EMITTING
THIS KEY IS WHAT MAKES --config INERT. Not "--config is inert" - it is not, as a
general fact, and writing it that way is how the property gets dropped. At Phase
0, which rendered no settings Secret, the flag was fully live.

AND NOT BECAUSE NO FILE EXISTED. A global settings.yaml may well exist without
this chart writing one: the hub seeds it from its own embedded defaults on a
first boot (cmd/server_foreground.go:104-109 -> config.InitMachine,
pkg/config/init.go:588-599), and those defaults carry no server key.
loadServerFromSettingsFile does not test existence, it tests the key
(:1344-1347).

THE TRIGGER IS THE KEY, NOT THE FILE, which is the whole reason this assertion
is worth its lines. "The chart mounts a settings.yaml" does not keep --config
inert. Nest the server section under a profile, rename it, deliver it in a
second file - every one of those still mounts a settings.yaml, and every one of
them hands the flag back its effect. This phase supplies the key; drop it and the
deployment is back where Phase 0 was.

  LoadGlobalConfig            pkg/config/hub_config.go:628
  loadGlobalConfigFromSettings                        :640
    reads GetGlobalDir() FIRST and UNCONDITIONALLY, and consults the --config
    path only `if !found`                             :647-660
  loadServerFromSettingsFile                          :1331
    found = the file parses AND raw["server"] exists AND is non-nil
                                                      :1344-1347

WHAT THE FLAG DOES WHEN IT IS LIVE, WHICH IS NOT A REDIRECT. It cannot be one:
GetGlobalDir (pkg/config/paths.go:188-194) is os.UserHomeDir() joined with
GlobalDir and TAKES NO ARGUMENTS, so no flag value can move the directory the
hub reads first. Dropping this key opens two narrower routes instead:

  :648-659  the --config path's own directory is searched for a settings.yaml,
            and if that file has a server key it becomes the SOLE source of the
            server config - a substitution of that section, nothing merged
  :635      failing that, loadGlobalConfigLegacy(configPath) (:699), which loads
            defaults, then ~/.scion/server.yaml (:772-775), then LAYERS the
            --config path over the result (:777-787) - an overlay

Both are real and neither is "the whole configuration load moves". Keep the
distinction: a mitigation scoped to preventing redirection does not cover an
overlay. A settings.yaml of only profiles and runtimes - a plausible
minimisation, and one that would look like a simplification - is what opens
them.

IN THE INERT STATE IT IS A NO-OP WITH NO SIGNAL, WHICH IS WHY THIS ASSERTION IS
THE ONLY WARNING THERE WILL EVER BE. --config is not marked deprecated -
MarkDeprecated appears twice in cmd/server.go, :236 and :290, both for
--production; the flag itself is a plain StringVarP at :237 - and the two
warnings in the load path (:668, :678) are about a server.yaml beside
settings.yaml, the second of them additionally requiring hasServerYAML(dir)
(:1393), which this chart creates nowhere. So while this key is emitted the flag
is accepted and ignored in silence, and without it it takes effect in the same
silence. The author of the refactor that flips it gets no runtime symptom to
discover. They get this message, at render time, or they get nothing.

Non-nil is asserted, not merely present, because that is the condition the
binary tests. `server:` with nothing under it satisfies hasKey and fails
raw["server"] != nil.

hack/verify.sh asserts the same property from the rendered output, in every
permutation. Two checks, on purpose: this one is the one config.extra cannot get
past, that one is the one a template change cannot get past.

The six keys below are nested under server: in V1ServerConfig. A file that
places any of them at the top level parses, installs, and is silently not read.

server.hub.public_url is refused outright. This is the only assertion in this
file that guards a channel the chart itself owns, and that is exactly why it was
missing until someone went looking.

The base URL has two consumers and they do not read the same source. Read from
the hub rather than assumed, and every step verified independently by review:

  settings_v1.go:517            PublicURL carries koanf:"public_url"
  settings_v1.go:1404-1405      if v1.Hub.PublicURL != "" { gc.Hub.Endpoint = it }
  server_foreground.go:1311-12  resolveHubEndpoint returns cfg.Hub.Endpoint - and
                                this is its FIRST statement, ahead of --base-url
                                at :1323 and SCION_SERVER_BASE_URL at :1331
  server_foreground.go:2102-08  initWebServer never reads cfg.Hub.Endpoint

So public_url outranks both other channels for the agent endpoint, and the OAuth
side cannot see it at any precedence. SCION_SERVER_BASE_URL is the only source
both consumers honour, which is why the chart sets that and nothing else - it
makes the two agree by construction rather than by the operator keeping them in
step.

REFUSED OUTRIGHT, not merely when it disagrees with hub.baseUrl. Permitting an
equal value would create a second source of truth that has to be kept in sync,
and the failure of that sync IS the bug: set both equal today, change hub.baseUrl
tomorrow, and you get the split - from a values file that passed the guard on the
day it was written. The permissive rule guards the moment of authorship, not the
lifetime of the file, and there is nothing on the other side of the trade. A
public_url equal to baseUrl buys the operator nothing, so the only configurations
it would admit are the ones that are useless now and dangerous later.

Rendering public_url therefore does not override the base URL. It SPLITS it: the
agent endpoint moves and the OAuth redirect does not, in one process, with both
values looking correct from their own side and no line in any manifest that
looks wrong. The failure surfaces later as redirects to the wrong host.

Reachable today, not hypothetically: config.extra is deep-merged over this tree
before these assertions run, so config.extra.server.hub.public_url renders. That
is the path hack/verify.sh proves this assertion against. The argv channel is
closed by the reserved-flag list and the environment channel by the schema; this
is the third channel and the chart is the only thing that writes it.

public_url is an ALIAS: a settings key that is a second name for a value the
chart already sets through a different channel. That is the hazard, and it is
not the server.hub prefix - nothing about that prefix is dangerous, and an alias
need not live anywhere near the value it renames. The collision check below
cannot see this one either, because the chart never writes public_url; the two
rules cover disjoint halves.

So this is a denylist of one, and Phase 5a owns replacing it with the alias
enumeration: every settings key that is a second name for something the chart
sets elsewhere, derived by walking what the chart sets and asking what else
names each quantity. Small, closed, checkable from the chart side alone, and it
narrows config.extra not at all. Phase 5a because it is the phase that wants a
public hostname and will reach for this key first.

Do not add a second key here instead of converting it. The failure mode of a
denylist of one is not that it stays at one - it is that the second key goes in
cheaply and the addition makes the list look adequate. Two entries read as a
considered policy; one entry reads as a stub, and a stub is the only thing that
ever gets converted.

SetSettingValue auto-migrates when the file's format cannot be detected
(pkg/config/settings.go:590-600), and the format detector keys on this field;
with it present the hub delegates to the v1 handler and never migrates. The
migration itself replaces the file with os.Rename
(pkg/config/settings_v1.go:2694), which returns EBUSY against a bind-mounted
path - and this file is delivered as a subPath bind mount.

The hub deliberately does NOT guard this path in hosted mode. That decision was
taken on the basis that the chart controls the input, which means this line is
the guard. Every other write to settings.yaml under the mount is soft; this is
the only one that turns into a hard failure.

hack/verify.sh enforces it under the name migration-rename-hazard, across every
values permutation rather than only the default one.

config.extra may add settings. It may not silently overwrite ones the chart
itself wrote.

This is the settings-file analogue of the reserved-flag list, and it is the same
argument one channel over: a value the chart computes and an operator's override
of it are indistinguishable in the rendered output, so the manifest keeps
reporting the operator's intent and every assertion downstream of the merge
still passes. The difference from the flag list is that this one needs no
enumeration - both documents are in hand at merge time, so the rule is derived
rather than listed, and it cannot be incomplete the way a list can.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT CATCH, and it is deliberate rather than an oversight. It sees
only keys the chart WRITES. It cannot see an ALIAS - a settings key that is a
second name for a value the chart already sets through a different channel.
server.hub.public_url is exactly that: the chart controls the base URL through
hub.baseUrl -> SCION_SERVER_BASE_URL and never writes public_url, so this check
is silent on it and the explicit refusal in assertSettings is what catches it.
The two rules cover disjoint halves and neither can see the other's. Phase 5a
owns enumerating the aliases; do not delete either rule believing the other
covers it.

Runs AFTER assertSettings so that a collision on a key with its own assertion -
the hub ID, the driver, server.mode, schema_version - still reports that
assertion's specific message. A generic "you overwrote a key" would be a
regression in every one of those cases.
