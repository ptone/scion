# Render-time guard assertions for deploy/helm/scion-hub, other than the
# reserved-flag list (tests/reserved-flags.sh) and the updateStrategy
# derivation (tests/update-strategy.sh). Those two are separate because they
# were separately verified; between the three, every render-time refusal in
# _helpers.tpl has at least one case.
#
# FAILS CLOSED, same contract as its two siblings: it asserts the number of
# assertions EXECUTED against a committed total and exits 2 on a short run,
# distinct from 1 for a real failure. "The harness did not run" and "the chart
# is broken" need different reactions from whoever sees red. Absence of a
# failure is not evidence of a check.
#
# NO CI WIRING, deliberately. Phase 6 owns that and may relocate this file.
#
# WHY SO MANY CASES ASSERT THE MESSAGE AND NOT JUST THE EXIT CODE: several of
# these guards are layered, and a layered guard silently becomes a single point
# of failure the moment you assert only the outcome. Where two independent
# layers refuse the same value, there is one case per layer, and the lower layer
# is reached with --skip-schema-validation - which is how an operator reaches it
# too.

# TOOL-PRESENCE ARM. A MISSING TOOLCHAIN MUST NOT BE REPORTED AS A BROKEN CHART.
# Without this every helm invocation fails, every assertion fails, and the output
# accuses the chart of dropping templates when the truth is that helm is not
# installed. Found by the first person to run this suite who was not its author,
# in a container without helm, in four minutes. A mutation suite inherits its
# author's environment, so the environment is the one variable it cannot mutate
# from the inside - the same shape as axis (d), answerable only from outside.
# "Nothing was analysed" is a THIRD outcome, distinct from clean and from failing,
# and it exits 2 with the other harness errors rather than 1.
#
# 🔴 AND THE PREFLIGHT DESTROYED THE MEASUREMENT THAT AUDITS THE PREFLIGHT.
# Adding it was correct and it stays. But the way to check whether an assertion
# in this file is reason-matched or fail-open is to run it with no toolchain and
# read which lines go green - and after this arm exists, there are no lines to
# read: the run reports ASSERTIONS_EXECUTED=0 and exits before any of them. The
# two vacuous greens at :110 and :184 were found that way; :212 survived because
# by then the probe that would have shown it could no longer be run.
# IMPROVING A MEASUREMENT CAN DESTROY ITS DIAGNOSTIC VALUE.
#
# So: AUDIT=1 bypasses the arm and lets the assertions run against a broken or
# absent toolchain, which is the only way to see which of them go green anyway.
# IT CAN NEVER CERTIFY ANYTHING - an audit run exits 2 unconditionally at the
# bottom, whatever the assertions say, so it cannot be pasted into a review as a
# pass and cannot be wired into run-all.sh by accident.

# as negative controls proving that length floors kept ordinary English
# renderable. The floors are gone -- no floor can separate a 40-character real

# not a tuning failure -- so these values are REFUSED now, and the rows say so.

# A deleted FP row is a cost that has stopped being counted.

# same three at cmd/server_ha_preflight_test.go:248-256 on ab0d227. THE ROUTES
# ARE TRANSCRIBED, SO THEY CAN DRIFT, which is what these rows are for.
#
# EACH NEGATIVE ASSERTS *WHICH* ROUTE FIRED, NOT MERELY THAT SOMETHING DID. The
# three routes overlap in the value space - postgres implies gcs by schema rule,
# and gcs plus proxy is route 3 - so a row that only checked for a refusal would
# stay green with two of the three routes deleted. Row r2 uses auth.mode oauth
# for exactly that reason: it is the only way to reach the postgres route with
# the gcs-plus-proxy route switched off. My first matrix did not do this and
# three of its rows were confounded by pre-existing schema allOf rules doing the
# refusing instead of this guard.

# THE GATE LIST IS PART OF THE CONTRACT, SO IT IS ASSERTED RATHER THAN TRUSTED.
# gke-deploy-lead's Critical 1 requires the refusal to name every unlandable
# gate in hub order. The number was reported as five for most of a day because a
# prober stopped at the first gate it could not construct and its extent was
# read as the preflight's extent; then it was reported as eight, because that
# prober supplied a WELL-FORMED IAP audience and never reached the format gate.
# So the list is no longer written here. It is read out of hack/ha-gates.txt,
# which cmd/helm_chart_ha_contract_test.go derives by driving the real
# validateHostedHAPreflight over the chart's own golden settings.yaml. If the
# hub gains or loses a gate, this assertion changes with it and no one edits a
# constant. THE DENOMINATOR IS STILL ASSERTED, not the presence of at least one:
# a message naming three of the gates would satisfy any per-substring loop that
# has no total.
#
# CONTROLS RUN AGAINST THIS DERIVATION on 2026-08-17, all four red:
#
#   seed a KEY the refusal cannot name  -> FAIL 8/9, names it as unnamed
#   delete hack/ha-gates.txt            -> META-FAILURE, exit 2
#   seed an unrecognised PROSE gate     -> META-FAILURE, exit 2
#   point the awk header at nothing     -> META-FAILURE "holds 0 entries"
#
# The last is the apparatus control: an extraction that quietly returns nothing
# is the failure mode that makes _ha_seen equal _ha_total on an empty list.
# 🛑 COMPLETENESS ALONE WAS THE HOLE, AND IT STAYED OPEN BECAUSE IT PASSED.
# Until now this block asserted only that the refusal names EVERY derived gate.
# A refusal naming every derived gate AND SEVERAL THE HUB NO LONGER HAS scored
# a clean pass, because nothing here had an upper bound. That is not
# hypothetical: 1b3c9418 deleted the server.auth.mode=proxy gate and moved the
# seven IAP gates behind `if cfg.Auth.Mode == "proxy"`, and this assertion
# stayed green over a refusal that still named all of them under oauth. A
# one-sided parity check reports "8/8 named" in exactly the voice it would use
# if it were right.
#
# So there are now TWO assertions per arm and TWO arms:
#   completeness  every derived gate appears in the refusal          (was here)
#   exclusivity   the refusal's enumeration names NO key the walk did not (new)
# and the arms are the proxy shape and the oauth shape, which since 1b3c9418
# are different lists. A single-arm guard cannot see a per-mode error at all.
#
# THE PRE-REGISTERED EXTENTS ARE WRITTEN HERE, ABOVE THE RUN, AND NOT READ OFF
# THE OUTPUT AFTERWARDS: proxy >= 3 gates, oauth == 1 gate, proxy > oauth.
# gd-spec-rev's sharpening of gd-em's rule is the reason they are stated rather
# than inspected - "a positive arm you read after the fact is just another
# number on the screen". The oauth arm carries the absolute count per ruling
# (p1) because its one gate is the session secret — Cloud SQL landed in P2 and
# server.database.url is no longer a gate; if that number moves, a phase
# boundary moved and a human is supposed to be interrupted. The proxy arm keeps
# a floor rather than a pin because pinning it is the hand-maintained constant
# this whole block exists to delete.
