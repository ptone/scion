# Render-time guard assertions for deploy/helm/scion-hub, other than the
# reserved-flag list (tests/reserved-flags.sh) and the updateStrategy
# derivation (tests/update-strategy.sh). Those two are separate because they
# were separately verified; between the three, every render-time refusal in
# _helpers.tpl has at least one case.
#
# FAILS CLOSED, same contract as its two siblings: it asserts the number of
# assertions EXECUTED against a committed total and exits 2 on a short run,
# distinct from 1 for a real failure. "The harness did not run" and "the chart
# is broken" need different reactions from whoever sees red. Absence of a
# failure is not evidence of a check.
#
# NO CI WIRING, deliberately. Phase 6 owns that and may relocate this file.
#
# WHY SO MANY CASES ASSERT THE MESSAGE AND NOT JUST THE EXIT CODE: several of
# these guards are layered, and a layered guard silently becomes a single point
# of failure the moment you assert only the outcome. Where two independent
# layers refuse the same value, there is one case per layer, and the lower layer
# is reached with --skip-schema-validation - which is how an operator reaches it
# too.

# TOOL-PRESENCE ARM. A MISSING TOOLCHAIN MUST NOT BE REPORTED AS A BROKEN CHART.
# Without this every helm invocation fails, every assertion fails, and the output
# accuses the chart of dropping templates when the truth is that helm is not
# installed. Found by the first person to run this suite who was not its author,
# in a container without helm, in four minutes. A mutation suite inherits its
# author's environment, so the environment is the one variable it cannot mutate
# from the inside - the same shape as axis (d), answerable only from outside.
# "Nothing was analysed" is a THIRD outcome, distinct from clean and from failing,
# and it exits 2 with the other harness errors rather than 1.
#
# 🔴 AND THE PREFLIGHT DESTROYED THE MEASUREMENT THAT AUDITS THE PREFLIGHT.
# Adding it was correct and it stays. But the way to check whether an assertion
# in this file is reason-matched or fail-open is to run it with no toolchain and
# read which lines go green - and after this arm exists, there are no lines to
# read: the run reports ASSERTIONS_EXECUTED=0 and exits before any of them. The
# two vacuous greens at :110 and :184 were found that way; :212 survived because
# by then the probe that would have shown it could no longer be run.
# IMPROVING A MEASUREMENT CAN DESTROY ITS DIAGNOSTIC VALUE.
#
# So: AUDIT=1 bypasses the arm and lets the assertions run against a broken or
# absent toolchain, which is the only way to see which of them go green anyway.
# IT CAN NEVER CERTIFY ANYTHING - an audit run exits 2 unconditionally at the
# bottom, whatever the assertions say, so it cannot be pasted into a review as a
# pass and cannot be wired into run-all.sh by accident.
