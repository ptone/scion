# Render-time guard assertions for deploy/helm/scion-hub, other than the
# reserved-flag list (tests/reserved-flags.sh) and the updateStrategy
# derivation (tests/update-strategy.sh). Those two are separate because they
# were separately verified; between the three, every render-time refusal in
# _helpers.tpl has at least one case.
#
# FAILS CLOSED, same contract as its two siblings: it asserts the number of
# assertions EXECUTED against a committed total and exits 2 on a short run,
# distinct from 1 for a real failure. "The harness did not run" and "the chart
# is broken" need different reactions from whoever sees red. Absence of a
# failure is not evidence of a check.
#
# NO CI WIRING, deliberately. Phase 6 owns that and may relocate this file.
#
# WHY SO MANY CASES ASSERT THE MESSAGE AND NOT JUST THE EXIT CODE: several of
# these guards are layered, and a layered guard silently becomes a single point
# of failure the moment you assert only the outcome. Where two independent
# layers refuse the same value, there is one case per layer, and the lower layer
# is reached with --skip-schema-validation - which is how an operator reaches it
# too.

# TOOL-PRESENCE ARM. A MISSING TOOLCHAIN MUST NOT BE REPORTED AS A BROKEN CHART.
# Without this every helm invocation fails, every assertion fails, and the output
# accuses the chart of dropping templates when the truth is that helm is not
# installed. Found by the first person to run this suite who was not its author,
# in a container without helm, in four minutes. A mutation suite inherits its
# author's environment, so the environment is the one variable it cannot mutate
# from the inside - the same shape as axis (d), answerable only from outside.
# "Nothing was analysed" is a THIRD outcome, distinct from clean and from failing,
# and it exits 2 with the other harness errors rather than 1.
#
# 🔴 AND THE PREFLIGHT DESTROYED THE MEASUREMENT THAT AUDITS THE PREFLIGHT.
# Adding it was correct and it stays. But the way to check whether an assertion
# in this file is reason-matched or fail-open is to run it with no toolchain and
# read which lines go green - and after this arm exists, there are no lines to
# read: the run reports ASSERTIONS_EXECUTED=0 and exits before any of them. The
# two vacuous greens at :110 and :184 were found that way; :212 survived because
# by then the probe that would have shown it could no longer be run.
# IMPROVING A MEASUREMENT CAN DESTROY ITS DIAGNOSTIC VALUE.
#
# So: AUDIT=1 bypasses the arm and lets the assertions run against a broken or
# absent toolchain, which is the only way to see which of them go green anyway.
# IT CAN NEVER CERTIFY ANYTHING - an audit run exits 2 unconditionally at the
# bottom, whatever the assertions say, so it cannot be pasted into a review as a
# pass and cannot be wired into run-all.sh by accident.

# visible in the suite at all, not so that it is quantified here.
#
# AND THE COST DID NOT RISE. Against the pattern shipping in main the FP count is
# IDENTICAL -- 608/1368, 32 distinct, before and after -- because dropping "(?i)"
# removes two while the anchor fix adds two. Membership changes; size does not.
# The two rows immediately below are the OUT side of that swap, and they are what

# ESTABLISH THAT THERE IS A RENDER BEFORE COMPARING RENDERS. Comparing two
# hashes is a bare negative wearing a positive's clothes: two failed renders
# agree, and this printed "ok render is identical for install and upgrade" on a
# machine where nothing rendered at all. It is the strongest false pass in this
# file, because the assertion it fakes - that hub identity survives an upgrade -
# is the one the whole hubId design exists for.
#
# 🔴 THE FIRST FIX FOR THAT WAS INCOMPLETE AND SHIPPED, AND THE REASON IS WORTH
# MORE THAN THE FIX. It tested `[ -z "$_a" ]`. But the defect was never "the
# output was empty" - it was "nothing rendered, and the check could not tell."
# Emptiness was the symptom in the world it was found in: no helm, so nothing
# on stdout. `render()` ends `2>&1`, so when helm IS present and the render
# fails, the output is not empty - it is the error message, and the two error
# messages are identical. Measured at 8cc8d9b with `hub.baseUrl` added to the
# schema's required list (helm v3.16.3+gcfd0749, /tmp/linux-amd64/helm):
#
#   install rc=1 bytes=127   upgrade rc=1 bytes=127   -z fires? NO   shas equal? YES
#   -> "ok    render is identical for install and upgrade"
#
# Found by gd-p0-rev-2 and gd-p0-rev-3 independently, from different containers,
# byte-identical. THE REMEDY ARRIVED CARRYING THE DEFECT IT WAS WRITTEN TO
# REMOVE, because it was written against the description of the bug rather than
# against its mechanism. So this now gates on what is actually claimed - that
# helm SUCCEEDED and produced the manifest whose identity is under test - and
# keeps `-z` as well, which costs nothing and is not the load-bearing arm.
