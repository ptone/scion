# C1: the cluster-scoped RBAC pair must not collide across namespaces.
#
# THE DEFECT. scion-hub.clusterRoleName built "<fullname>-<namespace>-agents"
# and then applied `trunc 63`. Truncation discards the namespace, which is the
# only part making the name unique, so releases of the same name in different
# namespaces rendered ONE ClusterRole and ONE ClusterRoleBinding name with
# different ServiceAccount subjects. By the Kubernetes API's documented apply
# behaviour the second apply updates the existing object, so the first release's
# cluster-wide secrets get/list and pods/exec create end up pointed at another
# namespace's ServiceAccount. NOBODY HERE HAS A CLUSTER; the apply consequence is
# documented behaviour and the COLLISION is what is measured. Filed by
# gd-regmis-rev, graded Critical by gke-deploy-lead, reproduced at merged main
# 1b3c9418 by gd-consumer.
#
# THE GATE. These objects render only when rbac.create AND
# runtime.listAllNamespaces are BOTH true, and both halves are pinned below.
#
# 🛑 WHAT A GREEN RUN OF THIS FILE DOES NOT MEAN. READ THIS BEFORE CITING IT.
# This change fixes C1: the TRUNCATION bucket. It does NOT fix C4 or C5, which
# are two further cluster-scoped collisions, both live, both Critical, and both
# PINNED AS PRESENT here - arm (o) and arm (q). Those arms are written to PASS
# WHILE THE DEFECT EXISTS. They are fences, not regression tests.
#
#   C1  needs a LONG release name - it fires only when the 63-byte cut lands
#   C4  release R beside release R-scion-hub, one namespace, len(R) 1..43
#   C5  the "-" between fullname and namespace is legal inside both operands,
#       so the joined string splits two ways. Renders at 33 bytes.
#
# 🔴 C4 AND C5 DO NOT TRUNCATE, AND THIS FIX IS GATED ON TRUNCATION. THE GATE IS
# KEYED ON THE ONE PROPERTY BOTH REMAINING CRITICALS LACK. So this PR closes the
# class that needs long release names and declares residuals on the two classes
# that fire on ordinary ones - `prod`, and a one-character release name. An
# operator reading "fixes the RBAC name collision" gets the rarest of the three,
# which is why the PR body says so explicitly and why this paragraph exists.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY THIS FILE ASSERTS EXACT NAME STRINGS AND NOT collide/distinct VERDICTS.
#
# It is a TRUNCATION BUCKET, not a pairwise collision (gd-p3-rev). Every
# namespace truncating to the same bytes lands on ONE object. Rendered, at
# release length 41, three namespaces produce one name:
#
#     team-alpha, team-alpha-staging, team-alpha-production
#       -> rrr...rrr-scion-hub-team-alpha   ALL THREE, one ClusterRoleBinding
#
# A FIXTURE ASSERTING "THESE TWO NAMES ARE EQUAL" PASSES ON A BUCKET OF TWO AND
# SAYS NOTHING ABOUT THREE - it is not a weaker test of the same thing, it is a
# test of a different, smaller thing, and the pair-shaped assumption is encoded
# in the assertion's own shape (gd-em, gd-regmis-rev). Pinning the exact rendered
# string per (release, namespace) captures the bucket for free and encodes no
# model at all.
#
# NO CLOSED FORM DESCRIBES WHEN THIS COLLIDES, AND THREE WERE TRIED. gd-em's
# ruling after the third was falsified. What is exact is the computation itself:
#
#     collide  <=>  trunc63trimSuffix(fullname + "-" + ns1 + "-agents")
#                == trunc63trimSuffix(fullname + "-" + ns2 + "-agents")
#
# and what a reviewer can hold, which no correction has touched:
#
#     ANY SET OF NAMESPACES WHOSE RENDERED NAMES SURVIVE TRUNCATION TO THE SAME
#     BYTES SHARES ONE ClusterRole AND ONE ClusterRoleBinding. THE CHART CANNOT
#     SEE THE OTHER NAMESPACES, SO IT CANNOT DETECT THIS AT RENDER TIME.
#
# THE HISTORY IS THE ARGUMENT FOR KEEPING MODELS OUT OF THE ASSERTIONS. Three
# successive inequalities of the form len(fullname) + 1 + sharedPrefix >= 63
# were published and each was falsified by widening the corpus, never by
# re-reasoning over the old one:
#
#   1. bare namespaces          agreed with 400 renders across two rigs.
#      Falsified: when one namespace is a proper prefix of another, the hyphen
#      beginning "-agents" continues the match past the shorter namespace's end.
#      NEITHER GRID HAD SUCH A PAIR, so no input existed that could make the
#      model say the other thing - 400 agreements measured the pair set.
#   2. with the "-agents" term  scored 0 misses over 16,994,448 exhaustive cases.
#      Falsified on real helm at 4 of 728: gd-regmis-rev's alphabet was {a,b,-},
#      IN WHICH THE STRING "agents" CANNOT BE SPELLED, so the class they had
#      identified by hand was unreachable in their own corpus by construction.
#      AN EXHAUSTIVE SEARCH IS ONLY EXHAUSTIVE OVER ITS ALPHABET.
#   3. any threshold against 63 misses the same class: one name untruncated at
#      62, the other truncated to 63 and pulled BACK to 62 by trimSuffix. Case
#      (m) below is that class, rendered.
#
# A CLOSED FORM OVER A STRING OPERATION IS A REIMPLEMENTATION OF IT, AND IT
# DIVERGES WHEREVER THE STRING OPERATION HAS A BRANCH THE ARITHMETIC DOES NOT
# MODEL. `trunc | trimSuffix` has exactly one such branch - does the cut land on
# a hyphen - and it defeated all three. Every misprediction was in the UNSAFE
# direction and none was an over-prediction, so C1's trigger set only ever grew.
#
# trimSuffix IS THE BUCKET-FORMING OPERATION, not defensive hygiene (gd-p3-rev).
# At release length 41, every team-alpha-SOMETHING namespace has "team-alpha-"
# as its surviving 11 characters, ending in a hyphen, so trimSuffix strips it
# and they all land on the SAME 62-character string. The non-members survive to
# 63 characters with no trailing hyphen and nothing is stripped. trimSuffix is
# the step that MERGES the survivors by erasing the character that still
# distinguished them.
#
# ONE MORE THING THE SUFFIX GREP TURNED UP (gd-p3-rev): "-agents" is a literal in
# FOUR places with no shared constant - here, and inline in rbac-role.yaml and
# rbac-rolebinding.yaml, where it is appended AFTER scion-hub.fullname has
# already truncated to 63 and so can reach 70 characters. Those are NAMESPACED
# objects and cannot collide across namespaces, so this is not a C1 finding; it
# is recorded because a future rename would diverge silently.
#
# THE FIRST COLLIDING RELEASE LENGTH IS NOT A CHART CONSTANT. It moves with the
# namespaces, and with fullnameOverride there is no release-length floor at all:
# case (e) collides at a ONE-CHARACTER release name.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# ONE-DIRECTIONAL FIXTURES PASS TRIVIALLY HERE. Any change that lengthens or
# hashes the name makes two colliding cases differ - INCLUDING a change that
# mangles every name in the chart. So the negatives are load-bearing: cases (f)
# and (g) assert that names which were always fine are BYTE-IDENTICAL to what
# the chart produced before the fix, and (g) sweeps rather than samples.
#
# MUTATION TESTED. Each mutation was applied to a copy of the chart, the copy
# was asserted to actually DIFFER from the original (an unchanged tree is a
# harness error, never a pass), and the suite was run against it:
#
#   A  pre-fix helper restored              red  9   the defect itself
#   B  hash unconditionally                 red 10   caught by the negatives, (f)(g)
#   C  digest over the TRUNCATED string     red  9   would re-collide the bucket
#   D  digest 10 -> 12 characters           red 17   every digest pin
#   E  orphan disclosure deleted            red  4
#   F  symmetric "delete both" cleanup      red  2   the ClusterRole asymmetry
#   G  gate on release-name length          red 10   fullnameOverride walks past it
#   H  scion-hub.fullname made injective    red  5   arm (o), the C4 fence
#   I  digest arm made to end in "-agents"  red 15   collapses (p)'s two ranges
#   J  separator "-" changed to ":"         red 30   arm (q), the C5 fence
#
# H AND J ARE THE TWO THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN ONE DAY. H is C4's fix and J is
# C5's. When either lands, the matching fence arm must be RE-PINNED DELIBERATELY
# rather than repaired, and the upgrade path checked, because both rename objects
# that already exist in clusters.
#
# WHAT J MEASURED THAT IS WORTH KEEPING EVEN THOUGH J IS NOT APPLIED:
#   - it DOES close all three known C5 instances;
#   - arm (q)'s four name pins go red and its SUBJECT assertion stays green,
#     which is correct - a separator change renames objects, it does not change
#     which ServiceAccount they bind;
#   - arm (o)'s subject assertion ALSO stays green, correctly reporting that a
#     separator fix does NOT fix C4;
#   - and it is NOT a one-token change. The digest arm ends
#     `trunc 52 | trimSuffix "-"`, which stops matching, so digested names come
#     out as `...-scion-hub:-7e1159cc5b` with a dangling separator. Anyone taking
#     J must change the trimSuffix with it.
#
# FAILS CLOSED, same contract as the other scripts here.

# the "s" of "staging". At 41 the truncation eats exactly that character and the
# two become one. Both were truncated, so post-fix both are digested; they are
# pinned here because 40 is the last length at which the pre-fix chart still

# (o) THE BOUNDARY OF THIS FIX: A SECOND, UNFIXED COLLISION CLASS.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THIS ARM PINS A DEFECT THAT IS STILL PRESENT. It is not a regression test for
# the fix; it is a fence around it, so that nobody reads a green suite as
# "cluster-scoped name collisions are solved".
#
# scion-hub.fullname branches on `contains $name .Release.Name`, so a release R
# and a release R + "-scion-hub" map to ONE fullname (gd-p3-rev). Every name in
# the chart is built from that fullname, so both releases render the SAME
# ClusterRole, ClusterRoleBinding, ServiceAccount, Service and Deployment - in
# the SAME namespace, at 30 bytes, with NOTHING TRUNCATED and a four-character
# release name.
#
# WHY THIS FIX CANNOT COVER IT, MEASURED RATHER THAN ARGUED. The two inputs to
# scion-hub.clusterRoleName are the fullname and the namespace, and both are
# identical for this pair - the ONLY differing input is .Release.Name. So no
# gate helps: gate on truncation and the digest never fires; hash
# unconditionally and both sides hash the same string. And feeding
# .Release.Name in would be worse than useless, because the ClusterRoleBinding's
# SUBJECT is the ServiceAccount, whose name comes from the same collapsed
# fullname and is also identical. Two distinct ClusterRoles would then bind ONE
# ServiceAccount: the grant stays shared and the only visible symptom - the
# duplicate name - disappears. THE RENAME WOULD HIDE THE COLLISION, NOT REMOVE
# IT. The fix belongs in scion-hub.fullname, it renames every object in the
# chart, and it is filed separately.
#
# gd-consumer rendered a second route into the same class (two fullnameOverride
# values agreeing on 63 characters, one namespace, 5 of 5 namespaced kinds
# identical) and graded it low as contrived. Same root cause, same fence: the
# non-injective operation is in fullname, upstream of everything measured above.
#
# IF THIS ARM GOES RED, DO NOT "REPAIR" IT BY EDITING THE EXPECTATIONS. Red here
# means scion-hub.fullname changed. That is the fix for the other defect and it
# is good news - re-pin these strings deliberately, and check whether the
# upgrade path for existing installs was handled, because that change renames
# every object in the chart.

# (q) C5: THE SEPARATOR IS AMBIGUOUS. THIS FIX DOES NOT CLOSE IT. IT COULD.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 🛑 THIS ARM PINS A LIVE, UNFIXED, CROSS-NAMESPACE CLUSTER-SCOPED COLLISION.
# Like (o) it is a fence, not a regression test. UNLIKE (o), THIS ONE IS INSIDE
# THIS HELPER'S REACH, so the fence is around a decision that was deferred, not
# around a defect that lives somewhere else.
#
# The readable arm builds  printf "%s-%s-agents" $fullname $namespace  and "-" is
# LEGAL INSIDE BOTH COMPONENTS. So the rendered string can be split two ways, and
# two different installs land on it:
#
#   release 'a'                        ns 'team-alpha-x-b'  -> a-scion-hub-team-alpha-x-b-agents
#   release 'a-scion-hub-team-alpha-x' ns 'b'               -> a-scion-hub-team-alpha-x-b-agents
#
# 33 bytes against a bound of 63. NOTHING TRUNCATES. No override. One-character
# release name. Present in the pre-fix chart and present after this fix, so it is
# not a regression introduced here - it is a case this fix does not reach.
#
# WHY IT IS NOT ANOTHER (o), AND THE DISCRIMINATOR IS THE SUBJECT:
# in (o) both installs bind ONE ServiceAccount, which is what makes a rename
# cosmetic there. HERE THE SUBJECTS DIFFER - two ServiceAccounts, two namespaces,
# contending for one ClusterRoleBinding name. Last writer wins and the loser's
# hub silently loses cluster-wide secrets get/list/create/delete.
#
# 📌 FILED AS C5, SEPARATELY FROM C1, ON gd-em's RULING - AND I ARGUED THE OTHER
# WAY AND LOST ON A POINT WORTH KEEPING. I claimed C5 belongs to C1 because the
# subjects differ, so a rename at this site WOULD be a real fix. gd-em accepted
# that reasoning and rejected the conclusion on one word: COULD.
#
#   A SEVERITY CLASS IS NOT A CLAIM ABOUT WHAT A HYPOTHETICAL REMEDY COULD CLOSE.
#   IT IS A CLAIM ABOUT WHAT THE REMEDY BEING BUILT DOES CLOSE.
#
# This change is GATED ON TRUNCATION. C5 renders at 33 bytes against a bound of
# 63, so the gate never fires on C5's inputs, no digest is applied, and the two
# names stay identical. Filing C5 under C1 would make this PR's approval imply
# coverage it does not have.
#
# 🛑 AND THE PROPERTY C4 AND C5 SHARE IS THE REAL FINDING, NOT EITHER DEFECT:
#   BOTH ARE INVISIBLE TO ANY TRUNCATION-GATED REMEDY, BECAUSE NEITHER TRUNCATES.
#   THE GATE IS KEYED ON THE ONE PROPERTY BOTH LIVE CRITICALS LACK.
#
# ⚠️ THE CLASSIFICATION IS CONTINGENT ON THE GATE, AND THAT IS RECORDED HERE
# BECAUSE A CONTINGENT RULING READ LATER LOOKS LIKE AN ABSOLUTE ONE. If anyone
# ever removes the truncation gate and applies the digest unconditionally, the
# argument above stops holding and C5 merges back into C1. Whoever does that must
# revisit C5's filing in the same change. Do not treat "C5 is separate" as a fact
# about the defect; it is a fact about the shape of this remedy.
#
# THE FIX IS KNOWN AND WAS NOT TAKEN UNILATERALLY. The digest arm ALREADY gets
# this right: it hashes  printf "%s/%s" $fullname $namespace  and "/" cannot occur
# in either component. Only the readable arm is ambiguous. Separating with ":"
# closes all three known instances, and the reason it works is a measured
# property from both ends rather than a preference:
#
#   ":" is ILLEGAL in a helm release name  - gd-consumer ran it: release "a:b" is
#       rejected, "ab" accepted as the control that proves the rig can say yes
#   ":" is ILLEGAL in a DNS-1123 label     - so it cannot occur in a namespace
#   ":" is LEGAL in an RBAC object name    - gd-p3-rev executed apimachinery
#       v0.29.0: these names go through IsValidPathSegmentName, which is why
#       system:masters is legal
#
# ILLEGAL IN BOTH INPUTS, LEGAL IN THE OUTPUT. That is what makes the split
# unambiguous BY CONSTRUCTION rather than by luck - the same property "/" already
# gives the digest arm.
#
# 🔴 MEASURED COST, AND IT IS WHY THIS WAS NOT TAKEN: it renames every install,
# 42 of 42 sampled, ZERO unchanged. A breaking rename for installs that never had
# the defect. gd-em declined to reverse the lead's cost ruling mid-build and has
# escalated the C4+C5 pair to gke-deploy-lead. Recorded here rather than slipped
# in, and my own summary of the position stands unsoftened: I DO NOT THINK A
# CHEAP FIX EXISTS - THE AMBIGUITY IS PRESENT FOR NEARLY EVERY INPUT, NOT ONLY
# FOR COLLIDING ONES.
#
# ⚠️ ONE NOTATION WARNING, FROM gd-consumer's RETRACTION OF THEIR OWN TABLE, AND
# IT IS THE TRAP THIS ARM EXISTS TO DOCUMENT. The separating identity is a TUPLE
# of (Release.Name, Namespace) - joined by a separator illegal in both operands,
# or hashed as a tuple. NEVER a bare concatenation. gd-consumer measured a tuple
# (NUL-joined) and published a column headed "Release.Name + Namespace"; anyone
# implementing that heading writes printf "%s-%s" AND REINTRODUCES EXACTLY THIS
# DEFECT. When the subject is string ambiguity, the notation is part of the
# artefact.
#
# IF THIS ARM GOES RED, THAT IS THE GOOD OUTCOME: the separator was disambiguated.
# Re-pin deliberately, and handle the upgrade path, because it renames broadly.

# (p) WHICH ARMS OF THE GATE FIRE, AND WHY THE MIDDLE CELL IS NOT AN ACCIDENT.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# gke-deploy-lead's three-cell table, which is a fact about THIS helper's arms
# and not a model of helm's string operations:
#
#   BOTH sides truncated     gate fires on both      both digested, digests differ
#   ONE side truncated       gate fires on one       one readable, one digested
#   NEITHER side truncated   gate fires on neither   readable vs readable
#
# THE MIDDLE CELL WAS PUT TO ME AS "DISAMBIGUATES BY ACCIDENT" - the two installs
# take different arms, so they differ for a reason that is not the reason the
# gate was written, and the next author to touch the helper deletes the accident.
# 100% of gd-regmis-rev's 167-case residual lives here, so it matters.
#
# IT IS NOT AN ACCIDENT, AND THE REASON IS A RANGE PROPERTY THIS ARM PINS:
#
#   readable arm ALWAYS ends with the literal  "-agents"
#   digest arm   ALWAYS ends with "-" + 10 characters of sha256sum, i.e. HEX
#   "agents" CONTAINS g, n, s, t - AND NONE OF THOSE ARE HEX DIGITS
#
# So no readable name can equal any digested name, at any length, for any input.
# The two arms have DISJOINT RANGES, and a cross-arm collision is not unlikely,
# it is unconstructable. That is a design property, so it is pinned here rather
# than labelled as luck - a comment saying "accidental" invites removal, and a
# failing assertion does not.
#
# THE THIRD CELL - "neither side truncated" - IS NOT ONE DEFECT. IT HOLDS TWO,
# AND THEY HAVE OPPOSITE ANSWERS. Do not collapse them:
#
#   C4, arm (o)   both inputs to this helper are IDENTICAL, and both installs
#                 bind the SAME ServiceAccount. No gate here can separate inputs
#                 it never sees, and a rename would remove the only symptom while
#                 leaving the grant shared. NOT FIXABLE HERE, and fixing the name
#                 would be worse than the defect.
#   C5, arm (q)   the inputs DIFFER and the two installs bind DIFFERENT
#                 ServiceAccounts in DIFFERENT namespaces. The names collide only
#                 because this helper joins fullname and namespace with "-", which
#                 is legal inside both. FIXABLE HERE, and currently UNFIXED.
#
# The discriminator is the ClusterRoleBinding SUBJECT, not the truncation state.
# Both arms measure it, because "neither side truncated" was the cell everyone
# reasoned about and nobody rendered.
