# Reserved-flag assertions for deploy/helm/scion-hub.
#
# Provenance: this is the script that produced 31/31 at 7911e16 and at 721fc77
# in the round-4 mechanical pass. Committed so the numbers are re-runnable by
# someone other than their author. Location is provisional; Phase 6 owns CI
# wiring and may relocate this. Nothing here is wired into CI on purpose.
#
# Adopted from gd-p0-rev-2's handover with FOUR changes, recorded so the
# provenance claim above stays exact:
#   1. CHART now defaults to this script's own parent directory instead of a
#      repo-relative path, so it also works from an unpacked package.
#   2. The short-run guard is an INEQUALITY, not a floor, per gd-em's ruling -
#      a run that executes MORE assertions than committed is the same defect
#      facing the other way. The message at the bottom changed with it.
#   3. A tool-presence arm, and an ASSERTIONS_EXECUTED line for run-all.sh.
#   4. 🔴 reject() NOW ASSERTS THE REFUSAL'S REASON, NOT ITS EXIT STATUS. This
#      is a change to what all 29 reject assertions MEAN, not merely to how they
#      are spelled - see the comment on reject() below for the three measured
#      worlds that satisfied the old form. rev-2 found it in its own helper and
#      specified the fix; the failing-message text is the only thing added.
#
# WHICH PARTS ARE STILL rev-2's: the 31 cases and the count. No case was added,
# removed or repointed at a different flag. What changed is the predicate every
# reject case is judged by, and item 4 is why the earlier version of this header
# - which said "No assertion was altered" and kept saying it after item 2 landed
# - was itself an instance of the defect this file exists to catch.
#
# FAILS CLOSED. Rule 9 applied to the tooling itself: it asserts the number of
# assertions EXECUTED, not merely the absence of a failure. A run that executes
# zero cases exits non-zero. The Phase 7 stage guard printed seventeen oks over
# an empty table and exited 0; this must not be able to do that.

# accuse the chart of a fault it does not have. The chart will not default it - a generated

# in a container without helm, in four minutes. A mutation suite inherits its
# author's environment, so the environment is the one variable it cannot mutate
# from the inside - the same shape as axis (d), answerable only from outside.
# "Nothing was analysed" is a THIRD outcome, distinct from clean and from failing,
# and it exits 2 with the other harness errors rather than 1.

#
# A REQUIRED VALUE ADDED BY A LATER PHASE INVALIDATES EVERY BASE IN THIS SUITE AT

# reject <flag> -- a flag the chart must refuse, AND THE REASON IS ASSERTED.
#
# 🔴 THIS USED TO READ `if helm template ...; then FAIL; else ok; fi` - any
# non-zero exit taken as proof of refusal. Three unrelated worlds produce a
# non-zero exit from a chart that was never consulted, and all three were
# measured, not imagined:
#
#   1. helm is not installed. "command not found" is non-zero. Twenty-nine of
#      the thirty-one assertions here printed "ok" on a machine with no helm,
#      declaring the reserved-flag mechanism verified. Only the two accept()
#      twins went red, and they exist solely because a reviewer insisted on a
#      positive twin in an earlier round.
#   2. the chart cannot render for an unrelated reason. Phase 1 adds a required
#      value; until BASE supplies it the render fails at schema validation and
#      all twenty-nine go green again - WITH HELM PRESENT, so no tool-presence
#      guard catches this one.
#   3. any future rename, syntax error or bad CHART path.
#
# Matching the message defeats all three at once, and matching THIS message -
# which names the specific flag - defeats a fourth: the wrong reservation firing
# and taking credit for the catch. Matching "execution error at" would not,
# because world 2 produces one too.
#
# The general rule, which cost four people most of a day to converge on: A CLAIM
# MUST BE CHECKED AT ITS MECHANISM, NOT AT ITS OUTCOME, BECAUSE THE OUTCOME IS
# WHAT A BROKEN WORLD ALSO PRODUCES. A negative assertion that checks the reason
# degrades closed for free; one that checks only the outcome degrades open.

  # "--dev-auth:" finds nothing and turns all 29 red. That failure is fail-CLOSED
  # and therefore safe, but it is a trap in the other direction: 29 reds invite
  # loosening the matcher until they pass, and the nearest loosening is
  # "execution error at", which is exactly the string a schema rejection also
  # produces. Normalise; never loosen.

  #     sends -grove    matcher -g   with colon: no match   without: MATCHES

  #     sends -c        matcher -c   with colon: MATCHES    without: MATCHES  <- control

  # An unanchored matcher lets the guard fire for the WRONG reservation and
  # still print ok. That is a FALSE GREEN, strictly worse than the all-red
  # failure a wrong dash-count produces, because nothing draws attention to it.
  # The last row is the control: it is the one that must match either way, and
  # without it "with colon: no match" on the first three rows is equally
  # consistent with a matcher that never matches anything.
  #
  # All three pairs are already explicit cases - c, config, g, grove, p and
