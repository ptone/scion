# chart-integrity.sh -- the positive twin for .helmignore breadth.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS.
#
# `.helmignore` is applied when Helm loads a chart DIRECTORY, not only when it packages one.
# An over-broad pattern therefore silently removes files from every `helm template`, `helm lint`
# and `helm package` invocation at once. Measured at 721fc77:
#
#   ignore templates/service.yaml -> `helm template` catches it (5 kinds -> 4)
#                                    `helm lint --strict` is BLIND (0 chart(s) failed)
#   ignore values.schema.json     -> `helm template` is BLIND (still 5 kinds, byte-identical)
#                                    `helm lint --strict` is BLIND
#
# The second row is why this file exists. Deleting the values contract makes the chart accept
# MORE and render IDENTICALLY, so the guard's removal is invisible to the guard's own success
# criterion. Every positive signal stays green while the protection is gone.
#
# The measurement this replaces was "helm package emits 0 files under tests/" -- a bare negative.
# It says what is absent and nothing about what survived. This script asserts what survived.
#
# Provenance: written by gd-p0-rev-2, adopted here whole. The 25 assertions and
# their messages are rev-2's; the changes made on adoption are the tool-presence
# arm, the ASSERTIONS_EXECUTED line for run-all.sh, and the inequality below.
#
# CONTRACT (shared with reserved-flags.sh and update-strategy.sh):
#   exit 0 -- all EXPECTED_TOTAL assertions ran and passed
#   exit 1 -- an assertion ran and failed
#   exit 2 -- the number of assertions executed was not EXACTLY EXPECTED_TOTAL,
#             or a required tool was absent so NOTHING WAS ANALYSED. Short and
#             long are both failures: a long run means assertions were added
#             without the number being committed in the same diff.
# Rule 9: assert the presence of N successes, never the absence of a failure.

# THE HOLD DESCRIBED BELOW WAS LIFTED. The paragraphs from "HELD AT 26" to

# is committed and this script exits 0. Read them as a log entry, not as status.
#
# CONTINUING THE DERIVATION. 39 at the end of the session-secret phase. The
# secrets phase adds four: E9's two, which assert that checksum/settings is a
# digest of a REDACTED PROJECTION (unchanged by rotating an OAuth client secret,
# and still moving for a non-secret change), and E10's two, which are the
# regression test for a false refusal the value-based half of that projection
# produced against a three-character client secret. -> 43. E11 adds the last
# two: the projection deletes the automatic pod roll on a credential rotation,
# the replacement for it is a paragraph in NOTES.txt, and those two assert that
# the paragraph prints when OAuth credentials are set and does not when they are
# not. -> 45. E9, E10 and E11 also add five META-FAILURE arms, which are not
# assertions and are not counted: they report that nothing was analysed.
#
# HELD AT 26 ON PURPOSE, AND THIS SCRIPT THEREFORE EXITS 2.
#
# The true Phase 1 figure is 35: 26 as adopted, +2 kinds (ConfigMap, Secret) in
# section B, +2 files (configmap-env.yaml, secret-settings.yaml) in section C,
# +5 in section E (the signing-key flip). The session-secret phase adds +3: E6
# and E7 in the inverted section E, and one more in section C, because that
# section asserts one file PER ENTRY in EXPECTED_FILES and secret-session.yaml
# is a seventeenth entry. -> 38. E8 then adds the last one, refusing a pod
# annotation derived from the session secret. -> 39.
# Nothing FAILS -- every assertion the chart is accused by passes. The only red
# is this number.
#
# gd-em is holding every numeric delta against 8cc8d9b while three blocking
# findings are open against it and EXPECTED_ASSERTIONS may still move. Exit 2 in
# this harness means "the run is not evidence", which is exactly the status of a
# count that has been deliberately not committed -- so leaving it wrong is the
# honest encoding of the hold, and bumping it would be the defeat gd-p0-dev
# warned about. Lifting the hold is a two-line change: 26 -> 35 here, and

# D. The base-url channel tripwire.  (1 assertion)
#
# 🔴 THIS ASSERTION EXISTS TO GO RED AT THE NEXT PHASE BOUNDARY. That is its
# purpose, not a side effect, and a reviewer who "fixes" it by bumping the
# constant without editing the prose below has defeated it.
#
# WHY IT IS HERE AND NOT IN PHASE 1. _helpers.tpl:1089 tells an operator that
# hub.args may not carry -base-url because "a later phase delivers this setting
# through another channel ... This chart delivers none of them yet: today the
# flag would simply take effect." :835 says the same of the whole $ownedByConfig
# list: "none of them lands anywhere. They are not rendered". Both are TRUE at
# this commit - measured, both channels empty, see the positive control below -
# and both become FALSE the moment the settings ConfigMap and
# SCION_SERVER_BASE_URL land. Eleven claims of exactly this shape have gone
# stale in this subtree and all eleven were caught by a person reading prose.
# None was caught by a check, because the only commit at which a transition
# tripwire can be installed is one BEFORE the transition. Landed after the
# boundary it watches, this is theatre: it would be written already knowing the
# answer, and it would never have been red.
#
# WHY IT IS ONE ASSERTION AND NOT TWO. The two halves rev-2 specified - measure
# the render against the committed number, and check the prose agrees with the
# committed number - are not independently useful. A render that gained a
# channel while the prose still denies it, and prose updated ahead of a render
# that has not moved, are the same defect seen from two sides: THE FILE AND THE
# CHART DISAGREE ABOUT WHAT THE CHART DOES. Reporting that once, with both
# measurements printed, is the honest count. gd-em's ruling fixed 25 -> 26 and
# 106 -> 107; this is the shape that fits that number, and the split is raised
# rather than silently resolved.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# PHASE 1 CROSSED THIS BOUNDARY. The render now carries exactly one channel,
# env(SCION_SERVER_BASE_URL) from configmap-env.yaml; argv still carries none.
# Both prose sites were edited in the diff that set this constant, and neither
# was edited by deleting the sentence and leaving the paragraph:
#   P0 :835  -> the $ownedByConfig header, now at _helpers.tpl:865, which names
#               which of the listed keys this release DOES deliver and which it
#               does not, rather than saying none of them land.
#   P0 :1089 -> the hub.args reservation, now at _helpers.tpl:1152, which names
#               -base-url and -storage-bucket as live and the other three as
#               still having no second source.
DELIVERS_BASE_URL_CHANNEL=1

# THE POSITIVE CONTROL COMES FIRST. "Zero channels deliver base-url" is a
# negative assertion and an empty render satisfies it perfectly. Section B

# established forty lines away by code that could later be reordered, so the
# subject is re-read here at the point of use.

# E. The signing-key flip.  (7 assertions)
#
# THE SECRET HAS LANDED. THIS SECTION HAS BEEN INVERTED, NOT RETIRED.
#
# Phase 1 wrote this section while auth.requireStableSigningKey defaulted to
# false and true was UNSATISFIABLE: the hub resolves a stable key from a
# pre-configured key, SharedSigningSecret, a secret backend or its store
# (pkg/hub/server.go:1445); SharedSigningSecret comes only from --session-secret,
# SCION_SERVER_SESSION_SECRET or bare SESSION_SECRET
# (cmd/server_foreground.go:1452-1462); and the chart rendered none of the three.
# With true and no key, pkg/hub/server.go:1634 errors, pkg/hub/server.go:1008
# makes it fatal, cmd/server_foreground.go:259 calls log.Fatalf. So E2 asserted a
# `fail` in configmap-env.yaml that REFUSED true, and E5 was a tripwire waiting
# for the day the Secret landed and nobody flipped the default back.
#
# The session-secret phase is that day. templates/secret-session.yaml renders the
# Secret, scion-hub.assertSessionSecret makes it unconditional, and the default is
# now true. The tripwire fired and was answered.
#
# E2 IS INVERTED RATHER THAN DELETED, ON A RULING, AND THE REASON IS GENERAL. The
# input Phase 1 refused - true with no config.existingSecret - is now the input
# that must RENDER. Deleting the assertion would leave that transition untested in
# both directions: nothing would catch the guard being reinstated by a bad merge,
# and nothing would record that the refusal was removed on purpose. An inverted
# assertion carries the history a deleted one throws away.
#
# THE DANGEROUS DIRECTION HAS ALSO FLIPPED, WHICH IS WHY E5 KEEPS BOTH ARMS.
# Under Phase 1 the harm was flag=false with a source present (silent logouts).
# Now the harm is flag=true with NO source present (every pod log.Fatalf on first
# boot), and that is reachable in one edit: delete secret-session.yaml, or make
# assertSessionSecret conditional, and the default render loses its only source
# while the default stays true. E6 and E7 close that off from the other side.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# "DEFAULT" HERE MEANS BASE, WHICH NOW CARRIES A SESSION SECRET - see the BASE
# definition at the top. That is the default in the sense that matters: what an
# operator gets having supplied the one value the chart refuses to invent for
# them. BASE_NO_SECRET is the same render without it, and it does not produce
# manifests at all; that failure is E6's subject.
_DEFAULT_RENDER="$("$HELM" template t "$CHART" "${BASE[@]}" 2>&1)"

# THE SUBJECT IS THE RENDER WITH FULL-LINE COMMENTS REMOVED, AND THAT IS NOT
# TIDINESS - IT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RED AND GREEN TODAY.
#
# configmap-env.yaml documents this exact mechanism in a plain YAML `#` comment,
# which means the comment RENDERS, which means every render of this chart -
# including one with no session secret in it anywhere - contains the string
# SCION_SERVER_SESSION_SECRET. A probe that cannot tell a source from a sentence
# ABOUT sources is therefore permanently satisfied, and cannot report the absence
# of the real thing.
#
# FULL-LINE comments only - first non-space character is `#`. A trailing comment
# after a value is left alone, because `#` inside a quoted YAML scalar is legal
# and stripping to end-of-line would delete real content.
#
# THE SAFE DIRECTION REVERSED WHEN THE DEFAULT DID, and the stripper must now be
# read the other way round. Under Phase 1, under-stripping gave a false RED and
# over-stripping a false GREEN. Now the probe's job is to confirm a source is
# PRESENT, so it is OVER-stripping that yields the false red and UNDER-stripping
# that yields the false green. Control 2 below is the one carrying the weight,

#
#   secret-session.yaml PRESENT, with the stripper:  SCION_SERVER_SESSION_SECRET

#   secret-session.yaml DELETED, no stripper:        --session-secret SCION_SERVER_SESSION_SECRET SESSION_SECRET
#
# The last two lines are the whole argument. Deleting the Secret template while
# the default stays true is the log.Fatalf-on-every-pod regression E5 now exists
# to catch, and WITHOUT the stripper that deletion is invisible: configmap-env.
# yaml's own explanatory comment names all three source spellings, so the probe
# keeps finding "sources" in prose after the real one is gone and E5 stays green
# through the outage. The stripper is the only reason the alarm can fire at all.

# --- E8. NO POD ANNOTATION IS DERIVED FROM THE SESSION SECRET. --------------
# check-secret-placement.sh already refuses the secret's VALUE in an
# annotation. This refuses a DIGEST of it, which that scanner cannot see and
# which is the form the mistake would actually take.
#
# The mistake is attractive, which is why it needs a guard rather than a
# comment. The session secret reaches the container through env, env is
# resolved once at container start, so rotating it does nothing until the pods
# restart - and the chart's own checksum/settings annotation is the established
# local idiom for exactly that problem. Adding checksum/session would look like
# consistency.
#
# It is not, because the two are not the same trade. Pod annotations are
# readable by anyone with pod read access, which is a strictly wider audience
# than the Secret's RBAC, and a digest over a single low-entropy credential is
# recoverable offline. checksum/settings covers a whole rendered document and
# is load-bearing in a way this would not be: settings.yaml is a subPath mount,
# frozen for the container's lifetime, with no restart remedy an operator can
# be told to run. The session secret has one, and values.yaml documents it.
#
# THE POSITIVE CONTROL IS A META-FAILURE, NOT AN ASSERTION, because a parser
# that has stopped finding annotations would report this green forever in the
# same words as a clean run. So the extractor must find checksum/env-config -
# an annotation this chart renders unconditionally - before its silence about

# That is the derivation axis and until this check it had no guard at all, on the
# one surface where the chart digests a Secret.
#
# The exposure was measured rather than argued: the digest preimage was recovered
# byte for byte and then used to predict helm's digest for three client secrets
# that had never been rendered, 3 of 3, at ~300k guesses/sec on one core. Against
# a provider-issued secret that is CONFIRMATION of a candidate an attacker
# already holds, not recovery - including against superseded values still in the
# ReplicaSet revision history. Lower bar than recovery, and the real one.
#
# WHY ARM 0 EXISTS, AND IT IS THE ONLY ARM THAT MATTERS. Arms 1 and 2 ask whether
# two digests are equal. If the two renders were IDENTICAL, the digests would be
# equal for a reason that has nothing to do with redaction, and this check would
# print PASS forever while measuring nothing. That is not hypothetical: the
# author's first run of this comparison by hand used a --set that changed a value
# to what it already was, and read the resulting "unchanged" as a defect in the
# projection. An inert arm renders exactly like a working one. So arm 0 asserts
# the two inputs really do differ, BY VALUE, in both directions, and it is a
# META-FAILURE rather than an assertion: if the inputs did not differ, nothing
# was analysed and a green line here would be a lie rather than a wrong answer.
#
# Arm 2 is the positive control for arm 1. Deleting the annotation, or hashing a
# constant, would satisfy arm 1 perfectly - and would silently break every
# settings upgrade, because settings.yaml is a subPath mount frozen for the
# container's lifetime. Arm 1 alone cannot tell "the secret is redacted" from

# E11. The rotation restart NOTES.txt owes the operator, because E9 removed it.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# E9 asserts that rotating an OAuth client secret does NOT move
# checksum/settings. That is the fix, and it deletes a real behaviour: before the
# redaction, a credential rotation rolled the pods, as a side effect of the
# credential being inside the digest. The same side effect was the verification
# oracle. They were one mechanism and they are gone together.
#
# The replacement is prose - values.yaml next to auth.oauth.web.*.clientSecret,
# and NOTES.txt, which is the only one of the two an operator sees without going
# looking. scion-hub.settingsChecksum's comment says "delete either of those and
# you have deleted the behaviour, not the annotation." That was an unasserted
# claim about a file nothing tested, which is the shape of every stale comment in
# this chart's history, so it is asserted here.
#
# RENDERING NOTES.txt WITHOUT A CLUSTER. `helm template` evaluates NOTES.txt but

# templates/NOTES.txt to a .txt manifest name, --show-only that file with --debug
# (helm exits non-zero because the prose is not YAML; --debug renders it anyway).

#
# The pass that guarded hub.podAnnotations and hub.podLabels enumerated the
# fields an operator thinks of as carrying text, and stopped there.
# hub.nodeSelector, hub.tolerations and hub.affinity are the same disclosure
# surface - free-form operator input, rendered verbatim into a pod spec that
# anyone with pod read access can read - and all three rendered a DSN clean while
# the identical string on hub.podAnnotations was refused. Measured before the
# fix, not reasoned about.
#
# 🛑 AND THEN THE SAME MISTAKE WAS MADE ONE LEVEL UP. The three arms added with
# that fix covered the three NEW call sites and left the five that were already
# there with no witness at all. Measured by gd-p3-rev: deleting the guard call
# from service.yaml, serviceaccount.yaml, configmap-env.yaml or either of the two
# original deployment.yaml lines left tests/run-all.sh at 155/155 GREEN and
# hack/verify.sh at 273/273 GREEN. With the hub.podAnnotations call deleted, a
# postgres DSN rendered verbatim into the Deployment and the suite reported
# success. A GUARD WHOSE DELETION IS INVISIBLE TO THE SUITE IS NOT A GUARD, IT IS
# A COMMENT. All eight call sites now have an arm, so all eight are load-bearing.
#
# The arms below are ordered by call site, not by importance, so that a reader
# comparing this list against `grep -rn assertNoCredential templates/*.yaml` can
# see at a glance whether the two agree. The count assertion at the end is what
# makes that comparison a test rather than a habit.
#
# THE ENUMERATION IS THE FRAGILE PART, NOT THE MATCHER. Every one of these
# assertions passes by the guard being CALLED on a surface; none of them can tell
# you about a surface with no call. The count assertion narrows this but does not
# close it: it catches a call site DELETED, and it catches a new template adding
# a sink and no call ONLY IF the author also does not add a call anywhere. A new
# template that adds two sinks and one call still passes. That residue is R1's
# subject - walking .Values once against a committed allow-list - and it is not
# closed here. It is stated so the next reader does not mistake eight green rows
# and a count for coverage of the chart.
#
# PLANTED VIA A VALUES FILE, NEVER --set-string. `--set-string` runs its own
# escape parser: 'Sc2\Back\Alpha' arrives as 'Sc2BackAlpha', so the chart is
# handed a DIFFERENT credential than the one written here, the guard correctly
# does not find the one we planted, and the arm records a false pass.
#
# ASSERTED ON THE ERROR STRING AND THE SOURCE NAME TOGETHER. A non-zero exit is
# not evidence that the guard fired: the first draft of this measurement was 13
# apparent confirmations that were all schema rejections, because the values
# overlay had been concatenated onto the base file and a duplicate `hub:` key
# silently replaced the base mapping. Nothing had reached a template. The clean
# arm at the end is what exposed it, and it is why that arm is here.
