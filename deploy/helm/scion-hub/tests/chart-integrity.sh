# chart-integrity.sh -- the positive twin for .helmignore breadth.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS.
#
# `.helmignore` is applied when Helm loads a chart DIRECTORY, not only when it packages one.
# An over-broad pattern therefore silently removes files from every `helm template`, `helm lint`
# and `helm package` invocation at once. Measured at 721fc77:
#
#   ignore templates/service.yaml -> `helm template` catches it (5 kinds -> 4)
#                                    `helm lint --strict` is BLIND (0 chart(s) failed)
#   ignore values.schema.json     -> `helm template` is BLIND (still 5 kinds, byte-identical)
#                                    `helm lint --strict` is BLIND
#
# The second row is why this file exists. Deleting the values contract makes the chart accept
# MORE and render IDENTICALLY, so the guard's removal is invisible to the guard's own success
# criterion. Every positive signal stays green while the protection is gone.
#
# The measurement this replaces was "helm package emits 0 files under tests/" -- a bare negative.
# It says what is absent and nothing about what survived. This script asserts what survived.
#
# Provenance: written by gd-p0-rev-2, adopted here whole. The 25 assertions and
# their messages are rev-2's; the changes made on adoption are the tool-presence
# arm, the ASSERTIONS_EXECUTED line for run-all.sh, and the inequality below.
#
# CONTRACT (shared with reserved-flags.sh and update-strategy.sh):
#   exit 0 -- all EXPECTED_TOTAL assertions ran and passed
#   exit 1 -- an assertion ran and failed
#   exit 2 -- the number of assertions executed was not EXACTLY EXPECTED_TOTAL,
#             or a required tool was absent so NOTHING WAS ANALYSED. Short and
#             long are both failures: a long run means assertions were added
#             without the number being committed in the same diff.
# Rule 9: assert the presence of N successes, never the absence of a failure.

# D. The base-url channel tripwire.  (1 assertion)
#
# 🔴 THIS ASSERTION EXISTS TO GO RED AT THE NEXT PHASE BOUNDARY. That is its
# purpose, not a side effect, and a reviewer who "fixes" it by bumping the
# constant without editing the prose below has defeated it.
#
# WHY IT IS HERE AND NOT IN PHASE 1. _helpers.tpl:1089 tells an operator that
# hub.args may not carry -base-url because "a later phase delivers this setting
# through another channel ... This chart delivers none of them yet: today the
# flag would simply take effect." :835 says the same of the whole $ownedByConfig
# list: "none of them lands anywhere. They are not rendered". Both are TRUE at
# this commit - measured, both channels empty, see the positive control below -
# and both become FALSE the moment the settings ConfigMap and
# SCION_SERVER_BASE_URL land. Eleven claims of exactly this shape have gone
# stale in this subtree and all eleven were caught by a person reading prose.
# None was caught by a check, because the only commit at which a transition
# tripwire can be installed is one BEFORE the transition. Landed after the
# boundary it watches, this is theatre: it would be written already knowing the
# answer, and it would never have been red.
#
# WHY IT IS ONE ASSERTION AND NOT TWO. The two halves rev-2 specified - measure
# the render against the committed number, and check the prose agrees with the
# committed number - are not independently useful. A render that gained a
# channel while the prose still denies it, and prose updated ahead of a render
# that has not moved, are the same defect seen from two sides: THE FILE AND THE
# CHART DISAGREE ABOUT WHAT THE CHART DOES. Reporting that once, with both
# measurements printed, is the honest count. gd-em's ruling fixed 25 -> 26 and
# 106 -> 107; this is the shape that fits that number, and the split is raised
# rather than silently resolved.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# PHASE 1 CROSSED THIS BOUNDARY. The render now carries exactly one channel,
# env(SCION_SERVER_BASE_URL) from configmap-env.yaml; argv still carries none.
# Both prose sites were edited in the diff that set this constant, and neither
# was edited by deleting the sentence and leaving the paragraph:
#   P0 :835  -> the $ownedByConfig header, now at _helpers.tpl:865, which names
#               which of the listed keys this release DOES deliver and which it
#               does not, rather than saying none of them land.
#   P0 :1089 -> the hub.args reservation, now at _helpers.tpl:1152, which names
#               -base-url and -storage-bucket as live and the other three as
#               still having no second source.
DELIVERS_BASE_URL_CHANNEL=1

# THE POSITIVE CONTROL COMES FIRST. "Zero channels deliver base-url" is a
# negative assertion and an empty render satisfies it perfectly. Section B
# already rendered successfully, but relying on that is relying on a fact
# established forty lines away by code that could later be reordered, so the
# subject is re-read here at the point of use.

  # while the chart rendered no ConfigMap ... and false the moment it rendered
  # all three. A raw grep cannot tell that sentence from the sentence it is
  # about. The two have opposite truth values and identical bytes.
  #
  # So the subject is the file with double-quoted spans removed. Quotation is
  # the only mood this strips; a phase that retracts a claim WITHOUT quoting it

# E. The signing-key flip.  (7 assertions)
#
# THE SECRET HAS LANDED. THIS SECTION HAS BEEN INVERTED, NOT RETIRED.
#
# Phase 1 wrote this section while auth.requireStableSigningKey defaulted to
# false and true was UNSATISFIABLE: the hub resolves a stable key from a
# pre-configured key, SharedSigningSecret, a secret backend or its store
# (pkg/hub/server.go:1445); SharedSigningSecret comes only from --session-secret,
# SCION_SERVER_SESSION_SECRET or bare SESSION_SECRET
# (cmd/server_foreground.go:1452-1462); and the chart rendered none of the three.
# With true and no key, pkg/hub/server.go:1634 errors, pkg/hub/server.go:1008
# makes it fatal, cmd/server_foreground.go:259 calls log.Fatalf. So E2 asserted a
# `fail` in configmap-env.yaml that REFUSED true, and E5 was a tripwire waiting
# for the day the Secret landed and nobody flipped the default back.
#
# The session-secret phase is that day. templates/secret-session.yaml renders the
# Secret, scion-hub.assertSessionSecret makes it unconditional, and the default is
# now true. The tripwire fired and was answered.
#
# E2 IS INVERTED RATHER THAN DELETED, ON A RULING, AND THE REASON IS GENERAL. The
# input Phase 1 refused - true with no config.existingSecret - is now the input
# that must RENDER. Deleting the assertion would leave that transition untested in
# both directions: nothing would catch the guard being reinstated by a bad merge,
# and nothing would record that the refusal was removed on purpose. An inverted
# assertion carries the history a deleted one throws away.
#
# THE DANGEROUS DIRECTION HAS ALSO FLIPPED, WHICH IS WHY E5 KEEPS BOTH ARMS.
# Under Phase 1 the harm was flag=false with a source present (silent logouts).
# Now the harm is flag=true with NO source present (every pod log.Fatalf on first
# boot), and that is reachable in one edit: delete secret-session.yaml, or make
# assertSessionSecret conditional, and the default render loses its only source
# while the default stays true. E6 and E7 close that off from the other side.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# "DEFAULT" HERE MEANS BASE, WHICH NOW CARRIES A SESSION SECRET - see the BASE
# definition at the top. That is the default in the sense that matters: what an
# operator gets having supplied the one value the chart refuses to invent for
# them. BASE_NO_SECRET is the same render without it, and it does not produce
# manifests at all; that failure is E6's subject.
_DEFAULT_RENDER="$("$HELM" template t "$CHART" "${BASE[@]}" 2>&1)"

# THE SUBJECT IS THE RENDER WITH FULL-LINE COMMENTS REMOVED, AND THAT IS NOT
# TIDINESS - IT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RED AND GREEN TODAY.
#
# configmap-env.yaml documents this exact mechanism in a plain YAML `#` comment,
# which means the comment RENDERS, which means every render of this chart -
# including one with no session secret in it anywhere - contains the string
# SCION_SERVER_SESSION_SECRET. A probe that cannot tell a source from a sentence
# ABOUT sources is therefore permanently satisfied, and cannot report the absence
# of the real thing.
#
# FULL-LINE comments only - first non-space character is `#`. A trailing comment
# after a value is left alone, because `#` inside a quoted YAML scalar is legal
# and stripping to end-of-line would delete real content.
#
# THE SAFE DIRECTION REVERSED WHEN THE DEFAULT DID, and the stripper must now be
# read the other way round. Under Phase 1, under-stripping gave a false RED and
# over-stripping a false GREEN. Now the probe's job is to confirm a source is
# PRESENT, so it is OVER-stripping that yields the false red and UNDER-stripping
# that yields the false green. Control 2 below is the one carrying the weight,
# and it is the control that would have been dropped as redundant.
#
# STILL LOAD-BEARING, RE-MEASURED AT THE SESSION-SECRET HEAD, AND NOW IT GUARDS
# THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. Phase 1 recorded that the stripper was what kept the
# default render reading as "no sources"; that reading is now obsolete, because
# the render really does carry one. Measured here, four renders:
#
#   secret-session.yaml PRESENT, with the stripper:  SCION_SERVER_SESSION_SECRET
#   secret-session.yaml PRESENT, no stripper:        --session-secret SCION_SERVER_SESSION_SECRET SESSION_SECRET
#   secret-session.yaml DELETED, with the stripper:  (no sources)   <- E5 fires
#   secret-session.yaml DELETED, no stripper:        --session-secret SCION_SERVER_SESSION_SECRET SESSION_SECRET
#
# The last two lines are the whole argument. Deleting the Secret template while
# the default stays true is the log.Fatalf-on-every-pod regression E5 now exists
# to catch, and WITHOUT the stripper that deletion is invisible: configmap-env.
# yaml's own explanatory comment names all three source spellings, so the probe
# keeps finding "sources" in prose after the real one is gone and E5 stays green
# through the outage. The stripper is the only reason the alarm can fire at all.
#
