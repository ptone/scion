# run-all.sh -- the meta-check. IT EXISTS BECAUSE RULE 9 DOES NOT COMPOSE.
#
# Each script beside this one fails closed on its own execution: it counts the
# assertions it ran and refuses to report success on a short run. That contract
# is airtight and it is also silent about a script that was never invoked. A
# script's fail-closed guarantee is a claim about ITS OWN run; none of them can
# make a claim about a run that did not happen. So a set of individually
# non-vacuous checks is vacuous AT THE SET LEVEL, and the stronger each script's
# internal contract is, the more confident a runner is that green means covered.
#
# That is not hypothetical. The same defect exists one repo directory over -
# several hack/check-*.sh scripts with nothing asserting they are all wired - and
# it was reproduced HERE, inside the remedy for the finding it came from, within
# an hour, by three authors each applying the fail-closed rule correctly and
# individually. This file is the generalisation: WHERE A CHECK COUNTS ANYTHING,
# COMMIT THE NUMBER AND FAIL ON INEQUALITY - AND THAT INCLUDES COUNTING THE
# CHECKS.
#
# FOUR COUNTS, COMMITTED, EACH FAILING IN BOTH DIRECTIONS:
#
#   EXPECTED_SCRIPTS     how many scripts must run. Adding a fifth fails here
#                        until someone bumps this number in a diff.
#   the on-disk set      every FILE beside this one, at any depth, must be
#                        enumerated below - either as a script to run or as a
#                        named exception - and every name below must exist. This
#                        is the half that catches the original defect: a script
#                        added to the directory but never wired in.
#   EXPECTED_FILES       how many files this directory holds. The set comparison
#                        alone is defeated by one file added as another is
#                        dropped; this is not.
#   EXPECTED_ASSERTIONS  the sum across all scripts. This duplicates each
#                        script's own EXPECTED_TOTAL on purpose. Without it,
#                        deleting assertions AND lowering that script's total is
#                        green everywhere - the breach produces no symptom that
#                        points at the number.
#
# 🔴 [HISTORY 2026-08-17] WHAT EXPECTED_ASSERTIONS DOES NOT TELL YOU, STATED
# HERE BECAUSE IT USED TO AND NO LONGER DOES. The total counts assertions EXECUTED, not assertions that
# meant anything. Those differ: an assertion that shells out to a missing binary
# and reads the non-zero exit as proof still executes. [HISTORY 2026-08-17,
# NUMERALS ARE PERIOD-ACCURATE AND NOT CURRENT: this file now carries 127
# assertions, not 106] Before the tool-presence
# arms below, a run with no helm reported 0/106 - visibly alarming, and load-
# bearing by accident, because the number was a pass-count masquerading as a
# coverage-count. Counting executions is the correct meaning for rule 9, and it
# converts that alarm into a serene 106/106. THE SIGNAL DID NOT SURVIVE IN THIS
# NUMBER; IT MOVED. It is now carried by the tool-presence pre-flights (here and
# in each script) and by every assertion matching the REASON for a refusal
# rather than its exit status. Do not weaken either one on the theory that the
# count would catch it. It would not.
#
# MUTATION TABLE. Every row EXECUTED, none inferred, and every row asserts the
# WHOLE summary line - exit code AND scripts AND assertions AND meta-failures -
# not the field the mutation was aimed at. That rule is not stylistic. The first
# version of this file [HISTORY 2026-08-17] shipped with the count check short-circuited once any
# script failed, and MM6 - the mutation that triggers exactly that condition -
# had already printed "assertions: 60/106" on a run recorded as green - a
# PERIOD-ACCURATE numeral, not a current one; the denominator is 127 today -
# because
# what was asserted about MM6 was its exit code. THE DEFECT WAS IN THE SUITE'S
# OWN OUTPUT AT THE MOMENT IT WAS DECLARED PASSING. A mutation that checks one
# field of a multi-field output has tested one field; the rest is decoration you
# have trained yourself to skim.
#
# RE-DERIVE, DO NOT EDIT: bash hack/run-all-mutations.sh. The rows below were
# printed by that script and pasted; it asserts it produced exactly ten of them.
# The numbers here were 107 for a while after the total moved to 127, because
# the original driver lived in a scratch directory and was thrown away - a
# measurement whose apparatus is not shipped decays into a quotation, and this
# table is where that was demonstrated rather than argued.

#
# MM5 is why EXPECTED_ASSERTIONS duplicates each script's own total: the mutated
# script alone reports PASS 3/3 and exits 0. MM6 and MM7 are the pair that keeps
# 1 and 2 distinct - "the chart is broken" and "the checks did not run" must not
# collapse into each other, and MM7 is the direction that collapses toward the
# alarming and wholly wrong reading. MM8 is the one that would catch a future
# script that forgot the count line, since "unknown" must not be read as zero.
# MM9 covers the named exceptions: an exception that stops existing must not
# quietly become an exception to nothing.
#
# MM4 is meta 4, not meta 2, and the extra two are worth reading rather than
# rounding off: removing one script trips the missing-file check, the
# unenumerated-set check, EXPECTED_FILES and the assertion total. FOUR
# INDEPENDENT COUNTS FIRING ON ONE MUTATION IS THE INTENDED BEHAVIOUR, not
# double-reporting - each is answering a different question about the same
# breach, and a fix that silenced three of them would leave the fourth as the
# only witness.
#
# The mutation driver is not in this directory: it copies the tree and edits the
# copies, so it is not an assertion script and enumerating it here would be a
# category error. It is hack/run-all-mutations.sh - IN THE REPOSITORY, which it
# was not, and its absence is reported by the hack/ gate near the bottom of this
# file rather than left to be noticed.
#
# NO CI WIRING, deliberately, same as the scripts it runs. Phase 6 owns that.
#
# CONTRACT:
#   exit 0 -- every script ran, every assertion passed, all three counts agree
#   exit 1 -- a script reported a real assertion failure
#   exit 2 -- a meta-failure: a script was missing, unenumerated, un-run, or a
#             count disagreed. Distinct from 1 because "the checks did not all
#             run" and "the chart is broken" need different reactions.

#
# EVERY REGULAR FILE AT ANY DEPTH, NOT `ls -1 *.sh`. The previous version defined
# "present" with a glob at depth 1, so it caught an unenumerated `orphan.sh` and

# `helpers/orphan.sh` - three of the four naming shapes. This file's own argument
# eight lines up is that "a glob would run whatever is present and could never
# notice that something is absent", and the half meant to enforce it was itself a
# glob, enforcing a `.sh` convention that is stated nowhere. Committing the
# convention in prose and asserting it would have been the weaker fix: a
# convention asserted in prose is the thing this entire round was about.
#
# So the rule is now positive and total: every file here is either run and
# counted (SCRIPTS), or named as a deliberate exception (NOT_RUN_HERE), or this
# runner. A file in none of those three fails the run whatever it is called and

# treat it as unbound; that is documentation, not something measured here, and

# is gd-em's rule 46, in the file written to prevent exactly this class. The

# --- count check 4: the assertion total ---------------------------------------
# UNCONDITIONAL. [HISTORY 2026-08-17] This condition used to read
#
#   real_failure -eq 0 && meta_fail -eq 0 && total_assertions -ne EXPECTED
#
# and both conjuncts are now deleted. The reason they were there was sound: when
# the total was parsed from each script's "PASS n/m" line, only scripts that
# SUCCEEDED contributed, so a red run was legitimately short and the note would
# have been spurious. THAT REASON STOPS APPLYING once the total is summed from
# ASSERTIONS_EXECUTED, which every script emits whether it passes or fails. The
# number now answers "did every assertion RUN", which is orthogonal to whether
# they passed - and that is the question rule 9 says the number is for. So this
# is a correct deletion following a change of premise, not a loosening.
#
# What the conjuncts cost while they were there: a single red assertion in
# update-strategy.sh printed "assertions: 102/106  meta-failures: 0" with helm
# fully present - a four-assertion shortfall on screen and nothing flagging it -
# because a failing script contributed 0 rather than n. The guard was switched
# off by the condition that made it necessary, which is the same family as a
# floor that passes an over-long run and as an assertion satisfied by its
# toolchain being absent.
