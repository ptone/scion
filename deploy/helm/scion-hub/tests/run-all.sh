# run-all.sh -- the meta-check. IT EXISTS BECAUSE RULE 9 DOES NOT COMPOSE.
#
# Each script beside this one fails closed on its own execution: it counts the
# assertions it ran and refuses to report success on a short run. That contract
# is airtight and it is also silent about a script that was never invoked. A
# script's fail-closed guarantee is a claim about ITS OWN run; none of them can
# make a claim about a run that did not happen. So a set of individually
# non-vacuous checks is vacuous AT THE SET LEVEL, and the stronger each script's
# internal contract is, the more confident a runner is that green means covered.
#
# That is not hypothetical. The same defect exists one repo directory over -
# several hack/check-*.sh scripts with nothing asserting they are all wired - and
# it was reproduced HERE, inside the remedy for the finding it came from, within
# an hour, by three authors each applying the fail-closed rule correctly and
# individually. This file is the generalisation: WHERE A CHECK COUNTS ANYTHING,
# COMMIT THE NUMBER AND FAIL ON INEQUALITY - AND THAT INCLUDES COUNTING THE
# CHECKS.
#
# FOUR COUNTS, COMMITTED, EACH FAILING IN BOTH DIRECTIONS:
#
#   EXPECTED_SCRIPTS     how many scripts must run. Adding a fifth fails here
#                        until someone bumps this number in a diff.
#   the on-disk set      every FILE beside this one, at any depth, must be
#                        enumerated below - either as a script to run or as a
#                        named exception - and every name below must exist. This
#                        is the half that catches the original defect: a script
#                        added to the directory but never wired in.
#   EXPECTED_FILES       how many files this directory holds. The set comparison
#                        alone is defeated by one file added as another is
#                        dropped; this is not.
#   EXPECTED_ASSERTIONS  the sum across all scripts. This duplicates each
#                        script's own EXPECTED_TOTAL on purpose. Without it,
#                        deleting assertions AND lowering that script's total is
#                        green everywhere - the breach produces no symptom that
#                        points at the number.
#
# 🔴 WHAT EXPECTED_ASSERTIONS DOES NOT TELL YOU, STATED HERE BECAUSE IT USED TO
# AND NO LONGER DOES. The total counts assertions EXECUTED, not assertions that
# meant anything. Those differ: an assertion that shells out to a missing binary
# and reads the non-zero exit as proof still executes. Before the tool-presence
# arms below, a run with no helm reported 0/106 - visibly alarming, and load-
# bearing by accident, because the number was a pass-count masquerading as a
# coverage-count. Counting executions is the correct meaning for rule 9, and it
# converts that alarm into a serene 106/106. THE SIGNAL DID NOT SURVIVE IN THIS
# NUMBER; IT MOVED. It is now carried by the tool-presence pre-flights (here and
# in each script) and by every assertion matching the REASON for a refusal
# rather than its exit status. Do not weaken either one on the theory that the
# count would catch it. It would not.
#
# MUTATION TABLE. Every row EXECUTED, none inferred, and every row asserts the
# WHOLE summary line - exit code AND scripts AND assertions AND meta-failures -
# not the field the mutation was aimed at. That rule is not stylistic. The first
# version of this file shipped with the count check short-circuited once any
# script failed, and MM6 - the mutation that triggers exactly that condition -
# had already printed "assertions: 60/106" on a run recorded as green, because
# what was asserted about MM6 was its exit code. THE DEFECT WAS IN THE SUITE'S
# OWN OUTPUT AT THE MOMENT IT WAS DECLARED PASSING. A mutation that checks one
# field of a multi-field output has tested one field; the rest is decoration you
# have trained yourself to skim.
#
# RE-DERIVE, DO NOT EDIT: bash hack/run-all-mutations.sh. The rows below were
# printed by that script and pasted; it asserts it produced exactly ten of them.
# The numbers here were 107 for a while after the total moved to 127, because
# the original driver lived in a scratch directory and was thrown away - a
# measurement whose apparatus is not shipped decays into a quotation, and this
# table is where that was demonstrated rather than argued.
#

#   MM9    named exception missing from disk      exit 2  4/4   127/127   meta 2
#
# MM5 is why EXPECTED_ASSERTIONS duplicates each script's own total: the mutated
# script alone reports PASS 3/3 and exits 0. MM6 and MM7 are the pair that keeps
# 1 and 2 distinct - "the chart is broken" and "the checks did not run" must not
# collapse into each other, and MM7 is the direction that collapses toward the
# alarming and wholly wrong reading. MM8 is the one that would catch a future
# script that forgot the count line, since "unknown" must not be read as zero.
# MM9 covers the named exceptions: an exception that stops existing must not
# quietly become an exception to nothing.
#
# MM4 is meta 4, not meta 2, and the extra two are worth reading rather than
# rounding off: removing one script trips the missing-file check, the
# unenumerated-set check, EXPECTED_FILES and the assertion total. FOUR
# INDEPENDENT COUNTS FIRING ON ONE MUTATION IS THE INTENDED BEHAVIOUR, not
# double-reporting - each is answering a different question about the same
# breach, and a fix that silenced three of them would leave the fourth as the
# only witness.
#
# The mutation driver is not in this directory: it copies the tree and edits the
# copies, so it is not an assertion script and enumerating it here would be a
# category error. It is hack/run-all-mutations.sh - IN THE REPOSITORY, which it
# was not, and its absence is reported by the hack/ gate near the bottom of this
# file rather than left to be noticed.
#
# NO CI WIRING, deliberately, same as the scripts it runs. Phase 6 owns that.
#
# CONTRACT:
#   exit 0 -- every script ran, every assertion passed, all three counts agree
#   exit 1 -- a script reported a real assertion failure
#   exit 2 -- a meta-failure: a script was missing, unenumerated, un-run, or a
#             count disagreed. Distinct from 1 because "the checks did not all
#             run" and "the chart is broken" need different reactions.
