# Operating the Substrate broker

Day-2 operations for a deployed `deploy/substrate/broker.yaml` broker: warming
a template before real traffic, what a broker restart does and doesn't
recover, cleaning up actors a restarted broker can no longer identify, and
where the runtime's other known limits are tracked. See `README.md` for
install and `cluster/README.md` for the cluster-level prerequisites these
procedures assume are already in place.

## Warm the template before first use

Creating the first agent on a given template builds its golden `ActorTemplate`
snapshot, which can take on the order of a minute or more — dominated by the
golden build itself, not broker or hub overhead. The hub's control-channel
dispatch has a fixed timeout; if the golden build plus actor bootstrap
doesn't finish inside it, the hub gives up and sends a rollback delete that
races the still-in-progress create. The broker's create finishes anyway,
leaving a **running, unbootstrapped actor the hub doesn't know about**,
holding a worker indefinitely. A cold template build is the easiest way to
hit this, but it is a general dispatch-timeout gap, not specific to this
runtime.

Warm a golden for a brand-new project by creating one throwaway agent first —
the first `CreateActorTemplate` for a project needs that project's atespace
to exist, and an ordinary `scion start` creates it as a side effect:

```sh
# Start a throwaway agent on the profile/template you're about to use for
# real. The first create against a new template builds the golden snapshot
# and can take well over a minute — expected here.
scion start --profile substrate warm-template-check "echo warm"

# Wait for it to actually reach `running` before treating the template as
# warm — don't just wait for the command to return.
scion list | grep warm-template-check

# Clean up the throwaway agent. The template and its golden snapshot are
# NOT deleted with it (there is no template GC yet) — that's the point: the
# next real create against the same template reuses the now-ready golden
# and takes the fast (sub-second broker dispatch) path.
scion delete warm-template-check
```

Re-warm before pointing real traffic at anything that changes the template's
content-addressed name — a new image digest, resource shape, sandbox class,
`worker_selector`, or `egress_trust_bundle`.

## After a broker restart

The broker keeps two things only in memory, never persisted: the per-agent
record used to report an agent's project/slug on `list`, and the control
token minted at bootstrap for exec/message. A broker restart — a pod
reschedule, a rolling update, an OOM kill, anything that starts a new
process — drops both for every actor a *previous* process created. The
actors themselves, their egress policies, and their workers are untouched on
the cluster; only this broker's memory of them is gone.

**The invariant: no delete or stop reports success while the actor exists**,
with two exceptions: an actor already in `ACTOR_STATE_DELETING` (see "A
pre-restart actor stuck in `DELETING`" below — the `DELETING` exclusion has
nothing to do with a restart by itself, but can combine with one); and a
pre-restart actor under a second substrate profile on a different `ateapi`
endpoint, which isn't probed until that profile's first `Run` (see
"Record-less-actor probe scope" below — not applicable to a deployment with
only one substrate profile). Otherwise, concretely:

- **Delete/stop of a pre-restart agent by its slug returns HTTP 409**
  (`substrate_agent_identity_unknown`) instead of the ordinary 404/202,
  naming the atespace and how many unidentified actors it holds. This is
  intentional: a 404 is treated as an idempotent completed delete, and a 202
  as a completed stop — either would let the actor, its egress policy, and
  its worker leak with no further signal. An explicit conflict, requiring an
  operator, is the safer failure.
- **If the underlying check itself can't run**, delete/stop return an
  explicit 5xx, never the idempotent success a failed check would otherwise
  fall back to.
- **Exec** on a pre-restart agent fails permanently for that actor — the
  bootstrap endpoint is one-shot, so a new broker process has no way to
  re-mint or recover a token an old process already used.
- **Message** is accepted and reported as delivered by the hub, but never
  actually delivered — a general gap in how a dispatched message ID reaches
  the broker, not specific to this runtime.
- Any agent created **after** the restart is unaffected.

### Cleaning up a record-less actor

The 409 response body carries only the atespace and a count, never an actor
name or a control token — identify the actor from the broker's own log or
your own records first, not from the response body:

```sh
# 0. Identify the actor. The 409 response body only proves at least one
#    record-less actor exists in this atespace; it does not name it, and it
#    is never a license to act on every name the broker's log turns up. The
#    broker logs the record-less actor NAMES at WARN on every such 409 (only
#    in its own log, never in the HTTP response). Because a rolling update
#    or `strategy: Recreate` can list more than one broker pod at once, find
#    the SPECIFIC pod that logged the line you care about, not an arbitrary
#    one (`kubectl logs deploy/...` picks one pod for you, which may not be
#    the one that logged this WARN):
kubectl -n "${BROKER_NAMESPACE}" logs --prefix --tail=-1 -l app=scion-substrate-broker \
  | grep -i "agent identity unknown"
#    Each matching line is prefixed "[pod/<pod-name>/scion-substrate-broker]"
#    -- note that pod name (call it POD below) and read the
#    "recordless_actors" field on that same line.
#
#    The actor THIS delete/stop is for is named "<project-slug>--<agent-slug>"
#    -- act ONLY on that one name, and only if it appears in POD's WARN line
#    and passes both checks below. The WARN line lists every record-less
#    actor in the atespace, which routinely includes OTHER pre-restart
#    agents in the same project that are still running (and, per the
#    atespace-prefix note below, possibly another project's actors sharing
#    the prefix). Those other names are NOT part of this procedure and must
#    not be deleted here: each is cleaned up through its own agent's
#    delete/stop, when that request hits this same 409.
#
#    For the one name that matches <project-slug>--<agent-slug>:
#      (i)  confirm its .metadata.createTime predates the broker CONTAINER's
#           current start in POD -- not POD's .status.startTime, which is
#           when the POD started and does NOT move when the kubelet restarts
#           a crashed or OOM-killed container in place (restartPolicy:
#           Always, the Deployment default). An in-pod container restart is
#           exactly the kind of "broker restart" this whole mechanism exists
#           to catch, so the pod's start time is the wrong boundary: use the
#           container's own state.running.startedAt instead:
kubectl ate get actor -a <atespace> <actor> -o yaml   # read .metadata.createTime
kubectl -n "${BROKER_NAMESPACE}" get pod "$POD" \
  -o jsonpath='{.status.containerStatuses[?(@.name=="scion-substrate-broker")].state.running.startedAt}'
#           An actor created after that timestamp is not a pre-restart
#           actor, whatever this 409 says -- do not act on it.
#      (ii) cross-check it against the hub's own agent list for this
#           project (its phase/name should match what you expect).
#    If more than one project could plausibly share this atespace (see the
#    atespace-prefix note below), confirm ownership with that project's
#    owner first. Only the one name verified this way -- read from POD's own
#    WARN log line, confirmed pre-restart against POD's own container start,
#    and matched against the hub's agent list -- may be acted on below;
#    never guess from the requested slug alone, and never act on the other
#    names the same WARN line lists.

# 1. Only once the actor is confirmed: delete its egress policy FIRST. This
#    order is mandatory, not a suggestion — deleting the actor before its
#    egress policy leaves the policy behind with nothing left to delete it
#    (the record-less-actor check only ever reports actors, so an orphaned
#    policy alone is invisible to this whole mechanism). There is no
#    dedicated CLI for this; call the ateapi Control service's
#    DeleteActorEgressPolicy RPC directly. Keep TLS verification ON: never
#    grpcurl -insecure/-plaintext against a real cluster endpoint.
#
#    Per deployment, fill in: <atespace> and <actor> (from step 0); the
#    CA bundle passed to -cacert, which is the CA that signs the
#    api.${ATE_SYSTEM_NAMESPACE}.svc certificate (cluster-internal, not in a
#    public trust store; with the settings this deployment uses it is the
#    ClusterTrustBundle named by substrate.cluster_trust_bundle, or the file
#    named by substrate.ca_file if you use that instead); and a host to run
#    grpcurl from that can resolve and reach api.${ATE_SYSTEM_NAMESPACE}.svc:443
#    directly (inside the cluster network) -- it is a headless,
#    cluster-internal service name, so it does not resolve from a
#    workstation (see the workstation form after the in-cluster form below).
#
#    The token is held in an exported environment variable, never written to
#    a file and never put on grpcurl's command line: with -expand-headers,
#    grpcurl itself replaces ${ATE_TOKEN} in the header with the value of
#    that environment variable, and the single quotes stop the shell from
#    expanding it first, so argv only ever contains the literal text
#    '${ATE_TOKEN}'. The export and both calls run in a subshell, so
#    ATE_TOKEN is gone as soon as it exits -- whether or not the calls
#    inside succeed -- with no separate `unset` needed.
kubectl get clustertrustbundle "${CLUSTER_TRUST_BUNDLE_NAME}" \
  -o jsonpath='{.spec.trustBundle}' > ate-ca.pem
(
  export ATE_TOKEN="$(kubectl create token scion-substrate-broker -n "${BROKER_NAMESPACE}" \
    --audience api.${ATE_SYSTEM_NAMESPACE}.svc --duration 600s)"
  grpcurl -cacert ate-ca.pem -expand-headers -H 'Authorization: Bearer ${ATE_TOKEN}' \
    -d '{"actor":{"atespace":"<atespace>","name":"<actor>"}}' \
    api.${ATE_SYSTEM_NAMESPACE}.svc:443 ateapi.Control/DeleteActorEgressPolicy

  #  Verify the policy is actually gone before touching the actor — an
  #  orphaned policy after this step is invisible to this whole mechanism, so
  #  this check matters, not just as a courtesy:
  grpcurl -cacert ate-ca.pem -expand-headers -H 'Authorization: Bearer ${ATE_TOKEN}' \
    -d '{"actor":{"atespace":"<atespace>","name":"<actor>"}}' \
    api.${ATE_SYSTEM_NAMESPACE}.svc:443 ateapi.Control/GetActorEgressPolicy
)   # ATE_TOKEN is gone as soon as the subshell exits, whatever happened inside
#    Expect a NotFound gRPC status. Anything else means the policy is still
#    there; do not proceed to step 2 until it reads NotFound.
#
#    From a workstation: the CA bundle is already fetched above by the same
#    command; port-forward instead of reaching the cluster-internal service
#    name directly, and keep TLS verification anchored to the in-cluster
#    name via -authority, which also sets the TLS server name used for
#    verification. Run the port-forward and both calls in their own
#    subshell, so ATE_TOKEN stays scoped to it just like the in-cluster form
#    above; guard the port-forward with a trap right after capturing its
#    PID, so it is stopped whether the subshell exits normally, is
#    interrupted, or is terminated. A separate `INT TERM` trap that exits is
#    required alongside the `EXIT` one: a trap only runs a handler and
#    resumes the script at the next command, so an `EXIT INT TERM` trap
#    whose handler is just the cleanup would kill the port-forward on
#    Ctrl-C and then keep going into `export ATE_TOKEN=...` and the grpcurl
#    calls below instead of stopping the block — `exit 130` (128+SIGINT) on
#    `INT TERM` makes the interrupt actually stop the block, and that exit
#    is what then fires the `EXIT` trap's cleanup. Wait for the
#    port-forward to actually be listening before the first grpcurl call:
#      (
#        kubectl -n "${ATE_SYSTEM_NAMESPACE}" port-forward svc/api 9555:443 &
#        pf=$!
#        trap 'kill "$pf" 2>/dev/null' EXIT
#        trap 'exit 130' INT TERM
#        sleep 2   # give the port-forward time to start listening
#        export ATE_TOKEN="$(kubectl create token scion-substrate-broker -n "${BROKER_NAMESPACE}" \
#          --audience api.${ATE_SYSTEM_NAMESPACE}.svc --duration 600s)"
#        grpcurl -cacert ate-ca.pem -authority api.${ATE_SYSTEM_NAMESPACE}.svc \
#          -expand-headers -H 'Authorization: Bearer ${ATE_TOKEN}' \
#          -d '{"actor":{"atespace":"<atespace>","name":"<actor>"}}' \
#          localhost:9555 ateapi.Control/DeleteActorEgressPolicy
#        # (same substitution for the GetActorEgressPolicy verification
#        # call above, run inside this same subshell)
#      )
#    Once verification reads NotFound, proceed to step 2.

# 2. Delete the actor itself, any_state so a non-RUNNING actor isn't
#    rejected:
kubectl ate delete actor -a <atespace> <actor> --any-state

# 3. Force-delete the hub's own agent record so it doesn't keep dispatching
#    to an actor that no longer exists. There is no --force on the delete
#    client -- call the hub API directly, with the access token from
#    ~/.scion/credentials.json (mode 0600), the same one scion itself uses
#    to authenticate; do not create or expect any separate "~/.scion/token"
#    file. Nothing that expands a secret may appear on the command line
#    (shell history, `ps`, `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`) or be left behind if this
#    is interrupted: the whole read/write/curl sequence runs in a subshell,
#    so its EXIT trap fires — removing the header file — as soon as curl
#    returns, not only when the surrounding interactive shell eventually
#    exits. A separate `INT TERM` trap that exits is required alongside the
#    `EXIT` one, the same reasoning as the port-forward subshell above:
#    without it, an interrupt would remove the header file and then fall
#    through to the curl call instead of stopping the block.
(
  read -rs TOKEN          # paste the hub token; not echoed, not in history
  HDR=$(mktemp); trap 'rm -f "$HDR"' EXIT; trap 'exit 130' INT TERM
  printf 'Authorization: Bearer %s\n' "$TOKEN" > "$HDR"; chmod 600 "$HDR"
  unset TOKEN
  curl --fail-with-body -X DELETE \
    "https://<hub-endpoint>/api/v1/agents/<agent-id>?force=true" -H @"$HDR"
)
```

`--fail-with-body` makes a 401/403/404 exit non-zero (with the body still
shown) instead of silently exiting 0, so a rejected request cannot be
mistaken for a completed step.

`force=true` does not skip the broker: the hub still dispatches the delete
to the broker exactly as a normal delete would — it only changes what
happens when that dispatch fails. Without `force`, a broker error
(including this same 409) fails the hub request and leaves the hub record
alone; with `force`, the hub logs the broker error and deletes its own
agent record anyway, regardless of what the broker did or didn't manage to
clean up. Run it only after steps 0–2 succeed: run it early and the actor,
egress policy and worker are orphaned with no further signal (the broker
error that would have surfaced this is now just a log line); run it while
other record-less actors remain in this atespace and the broker still
returns 409, so the project's on-broker files for this agent may also be
left behind.

### Fail-closed consequences worth knowing about, not fixed here

- **(a)** The atespace name derived from a project ID truncates that ID to
  its first 12 (sanitized) characters. This collision is not just
  theoretical: project IDs are client-supplied at project creation, so
  anyone able to create a project who knows another project's ID prefix can
  deliberately create one that maps to the same atespace. What that allows
  is a count disclosure (how many record-less actors project X's atespace
  holds) and the ability to force 409s on project X's genuinely-absent-slug
  deletes/stops — never a wrong-project action: the probe only ever turns a
  would-be success into an error, it never selects a delete target across
  atespace boundaries.
- **(b)** Once at least one record-less actor exists in a project's
  atespace, *every* delete or stop of an absent slug in that project returns
  409 instead of the usual idempotent 404/202, until every record-less actor
  in that atespace has been cleaned up (above).
- **(c)** A narrow window between `CreateActor` succeeding and this process
  recording it (spanning the running-wait, health check, and bootstrap —
  tens of seconds) makes a new actor look record-less to any concurrent
  delete/stop of an unrelated absent slug in the same project, or of the
  in-flight agent itself: both get a spurious 409 rather than a wrong
  action, since the probe never selects a target. Not hardened further in
  this phase.
- **(d)** See "A pre-restart actor stuck in `DELETING`" below — this is the
  other of the invariant's two stated exceptions.

All are accepted trade-offs of failing closed rather than risking a false
success.

### Record-less-actor probe scope

The record-less-actor probe only reaches the substrate profiles this broker
process has already resolved a manager for. Immediately after a restart,
that is just the default substrate profile — a second substrate profile
pointed at a *different* `ateapi` endpoint is not probed until this process
resolves it at least once (its first `Run`), so a pre-restart actor under
that second profile's atespace gets the ordinary idempotent 404/202 until
then. A deployment with only one substrate profile doesn't hit this case.

### A pre-restart actor stuck in `DELETING`

An actor already mid-delete when the broker restarts (for example, one this
same broker had started deleting, whose deletion never finished before a
crash) is **excluded** from the record-less-actor count above — its egress
policy is already gone, so counting it would turn an ordinary
stop-then-delete race into a false 409. The consequence: a delete of its
slug returns the ordinary idempotent 404 and the hub drops its record, while
the actor itself may still be sitting on the cluster, stuck in `DELETING`.
It can't be found by attempting a delete/stop — a `DELETING` actor never
produces the 409 above. Locate and clear it instead:

```sh
# 1. List the atespace's actors and note every one in ACTOR_STATE_DELETING
#    (there is no --state filter):
kubectl ate get actors -a <atespace>

# 2. For each candidate, compare its creation time against every currently
#    running broker pod's CONTAINER start (not pod start -- see above). Only
#    a candidate that predates every one of those timestamps is stuck; a
#    DELETING actor created after any of them may just be that pod's own,
#    ordinary, in-flight delete.

# 3. Only for a confirmed candidate: delete its egress policy exactly as in
#    "Cleaning up a record-less actor" step 1 above (tolerate NotFound if
#    it's already gone), then:
kubectl ate delete actor -a <atespace> <NAME> --any-state
```

## Known limits

The runtime's behavior in areas outside this broker's control — logging,
suspend semantics, egress validation, platform quirks — is out of scope for
this operations doc. The full list of verified defects, limitations, and
feature requests filed against the upstream runtime is tracked by ID
(`SB-D*` defects, `SB-L*` limitations, `SB-F*` friction, `SB-R*` requests) in
the project's feedback record; the ones most likely to affect day-2
operation of this broker are:

- Stuck `DELETING` actors that hold a worker indefinitely until force-cleaned
  (SB-D4), and force-clean itself leaking the actor's host-side directory
  (SB-D6) — see "A pre-restart actor stuck in `DELETING`" above.
- Slow first creates against a cold template, and a template's golden build
  competing with real actors for pool workers (SB-L6) — see "Warm the
  template before first use" above.
- gVisor snapshots only restoring on a matching CPU platform (SB-L13) — see
  `cluster/README.md`, "gVisor node pool".
- NetworkPolicy enforcement requiring an enforcing CNI with no built-in check
  (SB-F3), and router ingress having no authorization of its own (SB-L11) —
  see `cluster/README.md`, "Enabling NetworkPolicy enforcement", and
  `README.md`, "Known limitations".
- `worker_selector` matching the wrong label silently reporting "no free
  workers" instead of a selector-mismatch error (SB-F6) — see
  `cluster/README.md`, "`worker_selector`".

## TODO (not automated yet)

- The record-less-actor and stuck-`DELETING` cleanup above are manual runbook
  steps. Nothing in this folder scripts them.
- No golden-template garbage collection: a warmed-but-unused template's
  snapshot is never automatically reclaimed.
