# Postgres-backed SDK task store for A2A bridge standalone mode

**Date:** 2026-09-18
**Issue:** #1618
**Branch:** `scion/dev-a2a-taskstore`
**Author:** dev-a2a-taskstore agent

## Summary

Implemented a durable PostgreSQL-backed `taskstore.Store` for the A2A bridge's
standalone mode. Previously, standalone mode used `taskstore.NewInMemory` wrapped
by `ScopedTaskStore` for process-local ownership enforcement — task state was
lost on restart and invisible across replicas. The new `PostgresTaskStore`
persists full `a2a.Task` payloads in a shared Postgres database with SQL-level
ownership enforcement, CAS/version semantics, execution lease/heartbeat crash
recovery, retention cleanup, and cursor-based pagination.

## Changes

### New files
- `internal/bridge/pgstore_crossprocess_test.go` (~2100 lines) — 22 integration
  tests covering cross-process HTTP-level behavior, execution lease, crash
  recovery, retention, dedup, event delivery, caller isolation, plus regression
  tests for CRIT-2, CRIT-3, REQ-2, REQ-6, OPT-1.
- `internal/bridge/testdata/a2a-testserver/main.go` (~170 lines) — Subprocess
  test server with `-caller-id` flag, `READY <pid> <port>` protocol. Backdoor
  test endpoints removed per REQ-1.

### Modified files
- `internal/bridge/pgstore.go` (~650 lines) — execution lease columns
  (`exec_owner`, `exec_heartbeat`), `ClaimExecution`, `HeartbeatExecution`,
  `ReleaseExecution`, `ReapStaleTasks` (returns `[]string` for REQ-6),
  `PurgeTasksAndEvents`. Advisory lock on migration (REQ-4). Partial index
  `idx_a2a_sdk_tasks_exec` (REQ-5).
- `internal/bridge/bridge.go` — Added `sdkTaskStore` field, `SetSDKTaskStore`
  method, `reapStaleSDKExecutions` in janitor (emits terminal failure events
  per REQ-6), `PurgeTasksAndEvents` in `RunSweep` (standalone-only per REQ-2),
  heartbeat during `waitForTaskEvent` (CRIT-4), SDK-only task correlation
  fallback (CRIT-1).
- `internal/bridge/executor.go` — Wired `ClaimExecution` with retry loop
  (CRIT-2), fail-closed on all errors (CRIT-3), heartbeat during poll,
  `ReleaseExecution` on completion/error via defer.
- `internal/bridge/translate.go` — Deterministic artifact/message IDs via
  content hash (OPT-1).
- `internal/bridge/caller.go` — Exported `WithCallerIdentity` for test
  infrastructure.
- `internal/state/postgres.go` — Added `DB()` method for shared pool (REQ-4).
- `cmd/scion-a2a-bridge/main.go` — `SetSDKTaskStore(pgTaskStore)` wiring,
  shared pool via `NewPostgresTaskStoreWithDB` (REQ-4), startup recovery.
- `README.md` — Corrected false transactional consistency claims. Documents
  execution lease, crash recovery, retention, dedup, SSE cursor semantics.
- `.gitignore` — Added `/a2a-testserver`.

## Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE a2a_sdk_tasks (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    context_id TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
    owner_key TEXT NOT NULL,
    version BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    payload JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    exec_owner TEXT,
    exec_heartbeat TIMESTAMPTZ,
    project_id TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
    agent_slug TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
    caller_user_id TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
    last_event_cursor BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);
```

## Design decisions

1. **Owner key at SQL level** — Cross-replica ownership enforcement.
2. **JSONB payload** — Full `a2a.Task` stored as JSONB for SQL-level filtering.
3. **CAS via version column** — Distinguishes not-found from version-mismatch.
4. **Execution lease (exec_owner/exec_heartbeat)** — Only stale-lease tasks
   reaped; long-running legitimate work never affected. CAS on version +
   exec_owner prevents double-reap.
5. **Single-transaction retention** — `PurgeTasksAndEvents` deletes from both
   tables atomically.
6. **Shared connection pool** — Bridge state and SDK task store share a
   single `*sql.DB` pool via `NewPostgresTaskStoreWithDB` / `state.DB()` (REQ-4).
7. **Dedup at broker boundary** — Event log uses `dedup_key` with
   `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`.
8. **Deterministic artifact IDs** — `TranslateScionToA2A` uses content-hash-based
   IDs instead of random UUIDs, enabling reliable dedup_key generation (OPT-1).
9. **Fail-closed lease semantics** — All ClaimExecution errors prevent Hub sends
   (CRIT-3). Lease loss mid-execution returns error (CRIT-4).
10. **Terminal failure events on reap** — `ReapStaleTasks` returns reaped IDs;
    caller emits cross-replica-visible failure events to `a2a_task_events` (REQ-6).
11. **Active-task-safe retention** — Standalone mode skips unconditional
    `PurgeTaskEvents`; only terminal task events are purged via
    `PurgeTasksAndEvents` (REQ-2).
12. **BarrierTaskStore (R3)** — Deterministic create-completion signaling via
    sync.Once channel-based barrier. Replaces timed retry loop with zero timing
    assumptions. PrepareBarrier → yield → Await → single ClaimExecution.
13. **DurableRequestHandler (R3)** — Wraps SDK RequestHandler, intercepting
    SubscribeToTask with ownership-enforcing durable subscribe. Reads
    snapshot + last_event_cursor atomically, streams only new events.
14. **Per-event cursor tracking (R3)** — `_bridgeEventID` carried through SDK
    event metadata. Update uses `GREATEST(last_event_cursor, eventID)` to
    advance cursor monotonically to the specific event applied, not MAX(id).
15. **Durable correlation columns (R3)** — project_id, agent_slug, caller_user_id
    stored explicitly for cross-replica broker correlation and topic user
    validation. Pre-migration rows terminalized with fail-closed semantics.
16. **Heartbeat fence ordering (R3)** — waitForTaskEvent reordered:
    heartbeat→read→verify→return. No post-loss SDK event may be yielded.
17. **Store wrapper chain (R3)** — SDK→BarrierTaskStore→PostgresTaskStore.
    ScopedTaskStore removed (R3) — its in-memory ownership map was redundant
    with SQL enforcement and grew monotonically without bound.

## Test provisioning

```bash
sudo service postgresql start
TEST_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://scion:scion@localhost:5432/a2a_test?sslmode=disable" \
  go test -v -count=1 -run TestPostgresTaskStore ./internal/bridge/
```

## Milestone: Two-Replica Production Proof (RED-to-GREEN)

**Commits:** `e1cfa96` (RED), `09a759e` (GREEN)
**Branch:** `scion/dev-a2a-taskstore`, base `346b1f7` (origin/main), tip `12d063e`
**Proof artifact:** `/scion-volumes/scratchpad/projects/ge-a2a/taskstore-production-proof.md`

Added `TestTwoReplicaProductionPath_EndToEnd` — a two-process end-to-end test
proving the durable no-metadata broker correlation path works across distinct
OS processes sharing one PostgreSQL database.

**RED (e1cfa96):** Process B's `correlateToTask` fails (empty local cache,
task only in `a2a_sdk_tasks` not `a2a_tasks`) -> A times out -> TASK_STATE_FAILED.

**GREEN (09a759e):** `FindActiveSDKTaskForAgent` queries `a2a_sdk_tasks` for
unambiguous project+agent match -> B correlates durably -> A receives event ->
TASK_STATE_COMPLETED.

Changes:
- `pgstore.go`: Added `FindActiveSDKTaskForAgent` for durable no-metadata correlation
- `bridge.go`: Rewrote `correlateToTask` no-metadata path (local cache never authorizes alone)
- `testdata/a2a-testserver/main.go`: Added `-mode=production` (ScionExecutor + mock Hub)
- `pgstore_crossprocess_test.go`: Added production helpers + E2E test

Verification: race-clean, 3/3 repeated runs, all 7 cross-process tests pass,
`go build/vet ./...` clean.

### Expanded Production Proof (52c180d)

Addressed 6 EM findings. See `/scion-volumes/scratchpad/projects/ge-a2a/taskstore-production-proof.md`.

1. **Ambiguity fail-closed**: `FindActiveSDKTaskForAgent` uniqueness check always runs
   before accepting any cached nominee. 2 active tasks → rejection, 0 events.
2. **No legacy bypass**: SDK store authoritative when `sdkTaskStore != nil`. Legacy
   `a2a_tasks` only used in plugin mode (`sdkTaskStore == nil`).
3. **Streaming/resubscribe**: SSE `SubscribeToTask` on both replicas. Snapshot
   reflects current state, no replay, no `_bridgeEventID` leak.
4. **Negative streaming ownership**: Wrong caller/project get error -32001,
   no task metadata leakage.
5. **`_bridgeEventID` stripping**: DurableRequestHandler strips from all 5
   user-visible methods (GetTask, ListTasks, CancelTask, SendMessage,
   SendStreamingMessage). Hard wire-level assertions.
6. **Production context trace**: Unit test proves `WithRouteInfo` → `RouteInfoFrom`
   and `WithCallerIdentity` → `buildOwnerKey` → `PostgresTaskStore.Create` stores
   correct columns.

Changes:
- `bridge.go`: Refactored `correlateToTask` into `correlateWithMetadata` /
  `correlateWithoutMetadata` / `validateTopicUser`. No legacy bypass when SDK set.
- `durable_handler.go`: Added `_bridgeEventID` stripping to all user-visible paths.
- `pgstore_crossprocess_test.go`: 6 new tests (ambiguity, legacy bypass, streaming,
  negative streaming, metadata stripping, production context).

Verification: all 13 tests pass (7 original + 6 new), race-clean, `go build/vet`
clean. Clean rebase onto `346b1f7` (origin/main), no semantic conflicts.

### Rebase onto `346b1f7` (2026-09-18)

Conflict-free rebase onto current `origin/main` (`346b1f74ceaf541b2a8838c7b14b6a68ec73baa3`).
Changed-file intersection with main: empty. No semantic conflict resolution needed.

Rebased commit hashes:
- `e1cfa96` — RED test
- `09a759e` — GREEN fix
- `52c180d` — Expanded proof (6 findings)
- `12d063e` — Project log docs (branch tip)

All verification re-run post-rebase:
- 13/13 tests pass (7 cross-process + 6 production proof)
- Race detector: clean
- Full bridge test suite: pass (except pre-existing `TestNotifyAcceleratesDelivery`)
- `go build ./...` and `go vet ./...`: clean
- `git diff --check HEAD~12..HEAD`: clean

### Review Round 2 Findings (2026-09-18)

Addressed 4 EM findings from audit round 2 on `12d063e`.

#### 1. Canonical terminal-state handling (Critical — RESOLVED)

**Problem:** `FindActiveSDKTaskForAgent`, partial index `idx_a2a_sdk_tasks_agent`,
and migration terminalization used lowercase states (`'completed'`, etc.) but SDK
persists uppercase `TASK_STATE_*` via JSON marshal. Terminal tasks were never
excluded from active queries.

**Fix:**
- Introduced `sdkTerminalStates` / `legacyTerminalStates` / `allTerminalStatesSQL()`
  for a single source of truth on terminal state strings.
- `FindActiveSDKTaskForAgent`: uses `allTerminalStatesSQL()` (both cases).
- Migration: terminalization writes `TASK_STATE_FAILED` (canonical uppercase).
  Added normalization step: any legacy lowercase terminal → `TASK_STATE_FAILED`.
- Partial index: DROP + CREATE with canonical `sdkTerminalStatesSQL()`.
  Idempotent under advisory lock.
- `PurgeTasksAndEvents`: uses `allTerminalStatesSQL()` (both cases purgeable).
- `ClaimExecution`/`ReapStaleTasks` query predicates unchanged (already uppercase)
  but CAS guard also uses `allTerminalStatesSQL()` for completeness.

**Tests:** `TestTerminalStateExclusion`, `TestFinishTask1CreateTask2CorrelatesUniquely`,
`TestMigrationIdempotentAndNormalizesIndex`, `TestLegacyLowercaseTerminalExcluded`.

#### 2. Atomic terminal reap + durable event (Critical — RESOLVED)

**Problem:** `ReapStaleTasks` updated `a2a_sdk_tasks` then caller separately
appended events to `a2a_task_events`. Crash between them lost the event.
`Final: true` not set. Startup path emitted no events.

**Fix:**
- `ReapStaleTasks` now does CAS state transition AND `Final=true` event insert
  in a single Postgres transaction per task (`reapOneTask`).
- Dedup key `reap:<taskID>` prevents duplicate events on retry.
- Transaction rollback on any failure — no state-without-event possible.
- `reapStaleSDKExecutions` (janitor caller) simplified — no longer emits events.
- Startup path (main.go) already calls `ReapStaleTasks` directly — now
  atomically includes events. Both paths use the same method.

**Tests:** `TestAtomicReapTransactionRollback`, `TestReapIdempotencyOneEventOnly`,
`TestStartupAndJanitorShareReapPath`, `TestReapedTaskVisibleCrossReplica`.

#### 3. Notifier test isolation (Required — RESOLVED)

**Problem:** `TestNotifyAcceleratesDelivery` used hardcoded task ID `"notify-accel-1"`.
Cleanup only purged events, not the task row. Repeated runs → SQLSTATE 23505.

**Fix:** Unique task ID per run (`time.Now().UnixNano()`). Cleanup deletes both
events and the task row. 3x repeated run verified clean.

#### 4. Nit dispositions (Required — RESOLVED)

**README pool description:** Changed "separate connection pools" to "single shared
`*sql.DB` connection pool" with accurate description.

**ScopedTaskStore.ownership — RESOLVED in Round 3:**
Removed from standalone production path. The in-memory ownership map grew
monotonically without bound in long-lived processes. PostgresTaskStore
enforces `owner_key` at the SQL level on every operation. SDK now receives:
SDK → BarrierTaskStore → PostgresTaskStore (no ScopedTaskStore).

### Review Round 3 (2026-09-18)

Addressed 6 EM findings + security audit + ScopedTaskStore removal.

1. **Migration advisory lock connection scope (Critical):** `migrate()` now uses
   `*sql.Conn` to pin lock/migration/unlock to a single connection. Test:
   `TestConcurrentMigrationSerialization` (5 concurrent, no deadlock).
2. **Legacy terminal mapping (Critical):** `legacyToCanonical` map preserves
   individual mappings (completed→COMPLETED, canceled→CANCELED, etc.). Test:
   `TestLegacyTerminalMappingPreservesSemantics`.
3. **Notifier cleanup scope (Required):** Scoped `DELETE ... WHERE task_id = $1`
   with canary survival verification.
4. **Reap error propagation (Required):** `errors.Join` aggregates failures
   alongside partial successes. Test: `TestReapErrorPropagation`.
5. **One state predicate (Required):** `terminalStatesSQL` computed once at `init()`
   from `sdkTerminalStates`. All runtime predicates use this single source.
6. **Real rollback injection (Required):** CHECK constraint forces transaction
   rollback. Two-phase test proves atomicity.
7. **Security: PurgeTaskEvents cleanup (Required):** Eliminated all broad
   `PurgeTaskEvents` from 12 tests. Each uses scoped DELETE with unique per-run IDs.
8. **ScopedTaskStore removal (Required):** Removed from standalone path. SDK →
   BarrierTaskStore → PostgresTaskStore. No in-memory ownership map.

Verification: 280 tests pass (race clean), `go build/vet` clean.

### Review Round 4 (2026-09-18) — Correction at tip `772fbd1`

Addressed 1 Required finding + 1 Nit from round 4 review.

1. **Unscoped test cleanup (Required — RESOLVED):** Eliminated all bare
   `DELETE FROM a2a_sdk_tasks` and `DELETE FROM a2a_task_events` (19+ sites
   across `pgstore_test.go` and `pgstore_crossprocess_test.go`). Additionally
   fixed 7 static LIKE patterns and 12 static project_id predicates. All
   cleanup now uses `WHERE id = $1`, `WHERE project_id = $1`, or
   `WHERE task_id = $1` with per-run unique predicates generated via
   `time.Now().UnixNano()` or `randomSuffix()`.

2. **Startup reap logging nit (Nit — RESOLVED prior):** `main.go:508-516`
   already uses independent `if` checks (not `if/else if`), matching the
   janitor pattern in `bridge.go`.

3. **Canary assertion added:** `TestPostgresTaskStoreCanarySurvival` creates
   a canary row, performs scoped cleanup of an unrelated row, and verifies
   the canary survived.

4. **Indirect destructive helper scan:** Verified zero `PurgeTaskEvents`
   calls in test cleanup, zero `TRUNCATE`, zero shared cleanup functions
   with broad scope.

Verification: All tests pass against real PostgreSQL (100s), `go build/vet`
clean. Comprehensive `rg` scan confirms zero unpredicated destructive
statements in all test files.

### Manager preflight corrections (2026-09-18) — after round 4 candidate evidence

Precision corrections required by EM preflight before review round 5 consumption.

#### Corrections at `7151dd2`:

1. **state_test.go bare DELETEs → scoped LIKE cleanup**: All bare `DELETE FROM`
   statements replaced with LIKE-pattern cleanup scoped to per-run suffix.
2. **DDL constraint names → per-run unique**: Global constraint names made
   per-run unique with per-task-ID predicates.
3. **PurgeTaskEvents schema isolation**: Test runs in isolated per-run
   PostgreSQL schema (CREATE SCHEMA + search_path). Exact `n == 1` preserved.
4. **PurgeTasksAndEvents schema isolation**: Same approach, both state and
   bridge store tables migrated in isolated schema.
5. **UUID v7 collision**: `a2a.NewTaskID()[:8]` → `randomSuffix()`.
6. **CrashRecoveryKill race**: Timing below janitor threshold + membership check.
7. **LegacyTerminalMapping race**: Insert with `NOW()`, backdate only for purge.

#### Correction at `4f535ad`:

**Ownership-scoped advisory lock check:** Tagged all 5 test-owned migration
connections with a unique per-run `application_name` via `pgx.ParseConfig` +
`stdlib.RegisterConnConfig`. Lock-leak query changed from unscoped
`pg_locks WHERE objid = $1` to `pg_locks JOIN pg_stat_activity ON pid
WHERE application_name = $2 AND objid = $1`. Retry loop eliminated.

#### Correction at current tip:

**Regression test proof flaw:** `TestAdvisoryLockOwnershipScopedQuery` previously
held the unrelated connection on `testLockID+1` (different key), so the `objid`
filter alone explained `seesUnrelated=false`. Corrected to two sequential phases
using the SAME `testLockID` — only the `application_name` ownership filter
distinguishes them:
- Phase 1: owned marker acquires testLockID → query detects it →
  `pg_advisory_unlock` with `QueryRowContext.Scan(&released)` asserts
  `released==true` → conn closed
- Phase 2: unrelated marker acquires SAME testLockID → query with owned marker
  and same lock type/key returns false → `pg_advisory_unlock` with
  `QueryRowContext.Scan(&released)` asserts `released==true` → conn closed
- Both connections proven clean; no deferred silent unlocks

#### Test categorization

**Schema-isolated retention suites** (genuinely isolated per-run schemas):
- `TestPostgresStore/PurgeTaskEvents` — isolated state store
- `TestPostgresTaskStorePurgeTasksAndEvents` — isolated bridge + state stores

**Shared-schema concurrent proofs** (all processes share same database):
- 5-pair concurrent process proof with canary row survival
- `TestConcurrentMigrationSerialization` with ownership-scoped lock check
- `TestAdvisoryLockOwnershipScopedQuery` two-phase same-key regression

Verification at tip `ebcf4d4`: All tests pass against real PostgreSQL.
5-pair concurrent proof with canary byte-for-byte survival. Ownership
regression asserts explicit `pg_advisory_unlock` boolean results (both
`released==true`, no deferred silent unlocks). `go build/vet ./...` clean.

## Residual risks

- Hub side-effect replay: crash after Hub send but before completion record
  leaves the side effect un-replayed; task transitions to `failed` via reaper.
- SSE stream locality: streams are process-local.
- `go.mod`/`go.sum` updated for `grpc-gateway` and OTel version bumps
  (all indirect, no new direct deps).

### Post-acceptance lifecycle correction (2026-09-18)

The #1620 combined topology found three defects in accepted HA tip `23911e5`
(the relevant code is identical at reviewed parent `ebcf4d4`). The temporary
branch was created from that exact tip without advancing
`scion/dev-a2a-taskstore`.

- `919fcb1` is the committed RED for input-required return, continuation cursor
  replay, and caller/project/agent ownership negatives. `fd2f04a` corrects those
  boundaries using authenticated `RouteInfo` + `CallerIdentity` and
  `GetOwnedTaskSnapshotAndCursor`.
- `422b8f3` is the controlled cancel-convergence RED. On exact `23911e5` and
  intermediate `fd2f04a`, the SDK snapshot became canceled while the original
  lease remained, no final bridge event existed, the waiter exceeded the
  semantics-derived three-second propagation bound, and a late reply appended
  two events. Wrapper prototype `75fd9de` proved the mechanism but is
  intentionally superseded because it retained a crash window.
- `e5918d3` moves canceled snapshot/version CAS, lease release, task-scoped
  deduplicated final-event insertion, and cursor advancement into one PostgreSQL
  transaction. `a38768f` injects a real event constraint failure and proves the
  state/version/lease/cursor and event log all roll back. `f503e13` ensures a
  waiter whose lease was atomically released can emit only the matching canceled
  final boundary. Late broker replies are fenced without changing other terminal
  policy.
- Production proofs use two independent bridge processes sharing real
  PostgreSQL. Wrong caller/project/agent cannot cancel, read, or advance cursor;
  the original waiter returns canceled, the lease is released, terminal
  resubscribe is coherent, and the original Hub send is not replayed.

Final-tip verification used task-owned schema `final_correction_20260918`:

```text
lifecycle + atomic cancel suite, count=3: PASS (34.406s)
lifecycle + atomic cancel suite, -race: PASS (12.539s)
accepted cross-replica/cursor/ownership/reaper set: PASS (34.243s)
same accepted regression set, -race: PASS (35.724s)
full module go test ./... at final code tip: PASS (bridge 86.741s)

go vet ./internal/bridge: PASS
go build -buildvcs=false ./...: PASS
pre-existing schema canary: preexisting|must-survive
```

The fixture-only closed-SSE-channel observation and 700ms crash-wait timing are
separate from these confirmed product defects and are not counted as product
PASS/FAIL evidence. No live cloud calls were made; external-live remains false.
The correction proves task-scoped cursor/dedup behavior, not global exactly-once
semantics.

### Sixth-cycle upstream review follow-up (2026-09-18)

The follow-up branch `scion/dev-a2a-ha-lifecycle-pr-fixes` was created directly
from immutable correction `70c47cda668c87e7cc6556b63f82c0204d56141c`.
Current `origin/main` was exactly
`21c380344b774fc09a9147f38f9b96be4ca77f34`; it was merged normally in
`80f43eacccf5414b9bb668a805ecca3f0616f82c`. The merge had no textual
conflicts. Its six changed files were unrelated root-module formatting under
`pkg/hub` and `pkg/hubclient`; there was no A2A bridge, nested-module, or
dependency overlap. The unmerged baseline-tidy comparison at `07721e83` was
not imported, and `go.mod`/`go.sum` remain unchanged.

Two bounded corrections were made with committed RED evidence:

- `7fa428e56` reproduces `BarrierTaskStore.Create(ctx, nil)` panicking after
  `PostgresTaskStore.Create` returns wrapped `a2a.ErrInvalidRequest`;
  `f9a23493f` returns the inner result before reading `task.ID`. Public-path
  tracing through `jsonrpcHandler.ServeHTTP` -> `onSendMessage` ->
  `defaultRequestHandler.handleSendMessage` -> `ScionExecutor.Execute` ->
  `a2a.NewSubmittedTask` -> SDK `taskupdate.Manager.saveVersionedTask` shows
  that a public JSON-RPC request cannot supply this nil store argument: malformed
  or nil messages are rejected and the executor yields a non-nil task. The
  correction therefore hardens the internal store contract and prevents a
  direct/internal caller panic; it does not close a demonstrated remotely
  triggerable daemon-crash path.
- `81efa555d` proves string matching misses a wrapped PostgreSQL SQLSTATE 23505
  and falsely accepts both unrelated duplicate-key text and a SQLSTATE 23503
  carrying that text. `555bc3470` classifies through `errors.As` and the
  driver's `SQLState()` contract. The existing real-PostgreSQL duplicate-create
  regression also passes, proving actual driver error mapping to
  `taskstore.ErrTaskAlreadyExists`.

Go 1.26.1 `gofmt` was applied to the two attributed files
`pgstore_crossprocess_test.go` and `testdata/a2a-testserver/main.go` in
`97c9cd187`; `gofmt -l .` then reported no files for the whole bridge module.
No `time.After` change was made because Go 1.26 removes the alleged timer leak
and allocation optimization is outside scope. No Artifact nil check was added:
Artifact is a value struct and ranging nil `Parts` is safe.

Fresh real-PostgreSQL 15.19 verification used a task-local loopback daemon and
an unrelated task/event canary. The canary's before/after payload hashes were
identical (`42064f3eefa2a11c25b35c1e3f52fd23` and
`31082dfd852e84b48454c90f4f755dad`). Results:

```text
nil barrier focused RED: expected panic at barrier_store.go:96
nil barrier focused GREEN: PASS
SQLSTATE focused RED: all three required cases failed under string matching
SQLSTATE + real duplicate-create GREEN: PASS (0.058s)
lifecycle/cancel/rollback/ownership, count=3: PASS (36.497s)
same lifecycle set, -race: PASS (12.939s)
cross-process/cursor/ownership/reaper set: PASS (36.026s)
same accepted regression set, -race: PASS (36.969s)

go vet ./...: PASS

```

The original `origin/scion/dev-a2a-taskstore` ref remained exactly
`23911e531c4d3cb8f9d96d8b111a8329db3822e3`. The implementation-and-format tip
before this log update is `97c9cd187e6a01dda4b685b3954523dc0cc3cd5e`;
the pushed final ref is recorded in the durable sixth-cycle report.
