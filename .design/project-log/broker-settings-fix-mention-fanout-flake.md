# Test hygiene: leaked background goroutines in pkg/hub testServer (ptone/scion#2418 investigation)

Branch `scion/broker-settings-fix-mention-fanout-flake`, cut from `upstream-main`
(`GoogleCloudPlatform/scion` main) and rebased onto its later tip `169540efc` before opening the PR.
PR `ptone/scion#2434`, not draft. Part of `ptone/scion#2061`. Task brief: investigate the
order-dependent MentionFanout flake, `ptone/scion#2418`.

## Summary

This PR does **not** claim to fix `ptone/scion#2418`. It fixes a real, independently-confirmed test
hygiene bug found while investigating that flake, and references the issue only as a possible
contributor. The flake itself was never reproduced deterministically and has never been observed in
a real CI run.

## What was investigated

Task: find the "polluter" test responsible for
`TestMentionFanout_ParticipantRegistrationSurvivesExpiredAggregateContext`
(`pkg/hub/agent_mention_fanout_test.go`) occasionally getting delivery status `"error"` instead of
`"delivered"` in a full-suite run, per the `gs://scion-xproject-exchange/ci-main/findings.md`
(section 2) finding and the `ptone/scion#2337` precedent's method.

- Mined the actual CI job logs the finding was based on (`gh api .../actions/jobs/109999090628/logs`
  and `.../109999090664/logs`, run 36748018756): no "MentionFanout" match in either. This failure has
  never been observed in a real CI run — only in an investigator's own ad hoc local
  `go test -p 2 -count=1 -timeout 30m ./pkg/hub/` run.
- Ruled out `ptone/scion#2366` (the LogCapture flake's slog.Default-hijack fix): its polluter test,
  `TestAgentPortProxyThroughTunnel`, runs at position 6121 of 8040 in default `go test -list` order;
  the MentionFanout victim runs at position 510 — 5611 tests earlier — so it cannot be responsible in
  default order, and the two failures' mechanisms are unrelated regardless.
- Ruled out `ptone/scion#2417` (real-HOME-write pollution): no evidence connects filesystem writes to
  this victim's failure; the mechanism found (below) is in-process goroutine/scheduler contention, not
  filesystem state.
- 6 full-suite reproduction attempts on bare upstream main (`go test -p 2 -count=1 -timeout 30m
  ./pkg/hub/...`: 2 default-order, 2 `-shuffle`, one each at `GOMAXPROCS=2` and `GOMAXPROCS=4`) never
  reproduced the flake, on a 32-core/125GiB sandbox far heavier than a GitHub-hosted runner.
- `go test -race` on a ~104-test neighborhood (every test in `agent_mention_fanout*_test.go`,
  `agent_dm_operation_test.go`, `agent_dm_parity_test.go`, `notifications_test.go`) reproduced the
  victim failing 1 time in 4 attempts on unfixed code — with status `"unauthorized"`, not the
  originally reported `"error"` — and 0 times in 4 attempts with the fix below applied. This is
  evidence of a probable contributor, not proof of the root cause: the flake's status string differs
  from the original report, and the base failure rate (1/4) is itself not fully deterministic.

## What was found and fixed (the actual bug, confirmed independently of the flake)

`New()` (`pkg/hub/server.go`) unconditionally starts 5 background goroutines on every `*Server` it
constructs:
- `newChatLinkService()` (`pkg/hub/chat_link_service.go:54-61`), called once each for
  `telegramLinkService`, `discordLinkService` and `teamsLinkService` (`server.go:1379-1385`), each
  spawns a `cleanupLoop` goroutine (1-minute ticker).
- `NewBrokerAuthService()` -> `NewNonceCache()` (`pkg/hub/brokerauth.go:93-101, 144-156`) spawns a
  `cleanup` goroutine (ticker at half the nonce TTL).
- `NewPreviewService()` (`pkg/hub/access_constraint_preview.go:95-112`) spawns a `cleanupNonces`
  goroutine (1-minute ticker).

`testServer(t)` and `testServerWithBrokerAuth(t)` (`pkg/hub/handlers_test.go`), used at roughly 2200
call sites across 255 `_test.go` files in `pkg/hub`, only ever called
`srv.Shutdown(context.Background())` in `t.Cleanup`. That is a no-op here:
`Server.Shutdown()` (`server.go:4544-4552`) returns immediately whenever `s.httpServer` is nil, which
it always is for these tests — they exercise handlers directly via `httptest.NewRecorder()` and never
call `Start()`. Even on the path where `Shutdown()` does run its body, it still never closes the three
link services or `previewService` — only the separate `Server.CleanupResources()`
(`server.go:4613-4674`, documented for the combined-mode "no listener of its own" case, which is
exactly what a unit test is, just never wired to one) closes those.

Confirmed via a goroutine dump printed by a `-race` run that hit `go test`'s default 10-minute
timeout: exactly 267 goroutines parked in `chatLinkService.cleanupLoop`, exactly 89 in
`NonceCache.cleanup`, and exactly 89 in `PreviewService.cleanupNonces` — 267 = 89*3, matching exactly
89 leaked `testServer()`-shaped constructions each leaking precisely 5 goroutines. Separately, a
temporary uncommitted `runtime.NumGoroutine()` probe showed 4053 live goroutines after just the 509
tests that precede the MentionFanout victim in default order.

## Fix (test-only)

Added the missing `Close()` calls to both helpers' `t.Cleanup`, alongside the existing `Shutdown()`
call:
```go
if srv.telegramLinkService != nil { srv.telegramLinkService.Close() }
if srv.discordLinkService != nil { srv.discordLinkService.Close() }
if srv.teamsLinkService != nil { srv.teamsLinkService.Close() }
if srv.brokerAuthService != nil { srv.brokerAuthService.Close() }
if srv.previewService != nil { srv.previewService.Close() }
```
All five `Close()`/`Stop()` methods are idempotent: `chatLinkService.Close` and
`PreviewService.Close` are `sync.Once`-guarded; `BrokerAuthService.Close` -> `NonceCache.Stop` is a
plain `select`/`close`, idempotent under sequential calls but not concurrency-safe. These calls always
run sequentially in a `t.Cleanup` closure, so that is safe. (Both call sites now share this logic via
one `closeTestServerBackground` helper, per round 1 review.)

## Not fixed here (filed as follow-ups)

1. 17 other `pkg/hub` test files construct a `*Server` via `New(cfg, s)` directly instead of via
   `testServer(t)` and may share the identical leak pattern:
   `authz_bypass_agents_test.go`, `ge_exchange_route_test.go`, `handlers_auth_test.go`,
   `handlers_oidc_test.go`, `list_cursor_seal_test.go`, `seed_roles_test.go`, `server_test.go`,
   `template_bootstrap_test.go`, `template_file_handlers_test.go`,
   `reserved_platform_identity_test.go`, `agentrole_integration_test.go`, `bootstrap_test.go`,
   `external_bearer_ratelimit_test.go`, `harness_config_file_handlers_test.go`,
   `system_handlers_test.go`, `rs1_extended_test.go`, `workspace_handlers_test.go`.
2. `Server.Shutdown()`'s `if srv == nil { return nil }` guard (`server.go:4550-4552`) looks like a
   latent production gap independent of tests: any real caller invoking `Shutdown()` before `Start()`
   silently skips `ctxCancel()`, `brokerAuthService.Close()`, `scheduler.Stop()`,
   `notificationDispatcher.Stop()`, `lifecycleHookEvaluator.Stop()`, `presenceManager.Stop()`,
   `events.Close()` and `commandBus.Close()`. Separately, `previewService.Close()` is called by
   neither `Shutdown()` nor `CleanupResources()` in production code at all.

Both filed as fork issues on `ptone/scion`: `ptone/scion#2432` (the 17 files) and
`ptone/scion#2433` (the Shutdown production gap), each referencing this PR and `ptone/scion#2418`.

## Round 1 review (broker-settings-rev-fix-mention-fanout-1): REQUEST CHANGES

Full report: `reviews/broker-settings-rev-fix-mention-fanout-1.md`. The reviewer independently
measured the leak (base leaks exactly 5 goroutines per server, head leaks 0 with `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`
unset; +10/server gRPC-client goroutines remain on head when it is set — see the F1 disposition below)
and confirmed all gates green. One Required finding blocked APPROVE; everything else was non-blocking.

| # | Finding | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| R1 (Required) | The comment at `handlers_test.go:78-88` stated the ptone/scion#2418 causal link as fact, undercounted the leak as 4 goroutines (missing `previewService`), and claimed every `Close`/`Stop` is `sync.Once`-guarded, which is false for `NonceCache.Stop` (plain `select`/`close`). | **Fixed.** Rewrote the comment; extracted it onto a new `closeTestServerBackground` helper (also closes O2/N2 below). States only the leak, counts all 5 services, describes `NonceCache.Stop` accurately, and calls ptone/scion#2418 a possible contributor only. |
| O1 (Optional) | The same "sync.Once for all five" wording also appears in the commit message, PR body, project log, and the ptone/scion#2432 body. | **Fixed** in the PR body (one `gh api -X PATCH` call), this log, and the ptone/scion#2432 body. The original commit message (d513fb7f7) is left as-is per the reviewer's own note that it need not be amended; the round 1 commit and this log now carry the correction. |
| O2 (Optional) | The same 15-line close block is duplicated in `testServer` and `testServerWithBrokerAuth`. | **Fixed.** Extracted into `closeTestServerBackground(srv *Server)`; both helpers call it. |
| N1 (Nit) | ptone/scion#2432 and ptone/scion#2433 bodies still said "PR TBD". | **Fixed.** Both now say ptone/scion#2434. |
| N2 (Nit) | The PR body's claim that the Close calls are "safe even for the handful of tests (`chat_link_handlers_test.go`) that already close these same services themselves" is imprecise — those tests close standalone services they build themselves, not `srv`'s fields. | **Fixed** as a drive-by while editing the same paragraph for O1: the PR body now states accurately that those tests close their own separately-built services, so no service is ever double-closed. |
| F1 (FYI) | In a GCP-configured sandbox (`GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` set), `logQueryService`'s Cloud Logging gRPC client leaks ~10 goroutines/server; only `CleanupResources()` closes it. `metricsDashboard` has the same pattern. Not seen in CI. | **Added** as a new "FYI" section in the ptone/scion#2432 body, with the file:line and goroutine breakdown, as a candidate for that same follow-up. Not fixed in this PR — still test-only, still scoped to the 5-goroutine leak this PR's leak count is about. |
| F2, F3, F4 (FYI) | Cleanup ordering is correct; `previewService` is nil-guarded correctly; the ptone/scion#2418 comment is accurate. | No action needed — informational, confirms existing behavior/text is already correct. |

## Gates re-run after round 1 fixes

- Leak measurement (temporary, uncommitted probe calling `testServer`/`testServerWithBrokerAuth` 50x
  each in subtests, comparing `runtime.NumGoroutine()` before/after, matching the reviewer's method):
  with `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` set (this sandbox's ambient env, `deploy-demo-test`), delta was +1000
  over 100 servers (10/server) — exactly the separately-tracked, out-of-scope `logQueryService` gRPC
  leak from F1/round-1, not a regression of this fix. With `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` unset (CI-like,
  matching `.github/workflows/*.yml`), delta was **0** over 100 servers, confirming the fix still
  eliminates the 5-goroutine leak this PR targets.

## GoogleCloudPlatform/scion#2184 Gemini comment (upstream mirror of ptone/scion#2434)

Gemini, at `handlers_test.go:107`: `srv.Shutdown()` returns early when `srv.httpServer` is nil, so
`srv.ctxCancel` is never called in unit tests either; suggested calling it first in
`closeTestServerBackground`.

**Judged valid and safe, and applied.** `srv.ctx` (the Server-lifetime context `New()` builds via
`context.WithCancel`) is read in production by exactly two `*Server` methods —
`handleSystemImagesPull` and `handleSystemImagesBuild` — each only inside a goroutine spawned when
that specific HTTP handler is invoked. No test in `pkg/hub` calls either handler, so nothing in the
current suite is ever bound to `srv.ctx` by the time a test's cleanup runs. `context.CancelFunc` is
documented idempotent, so a double call (on the rare path where `Shutdown()` already called it) is
safe, and nothing in `closeTestServerBackground`'s own Close/Stop calls or the later `s.Close()` (the
test's own store) depends on `srv.ctx` remaining valid. Added `srv.ctxCancel()`, nil-guarded, as the
first step, with a one-line doc update.

**Measured impact: none currently, confirmed by direct A/B comparison.** The leak probe (50x
`testServer` + 50x `testServerWithBrokerAuth`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` unset) showed delta=0 both with
and without the `srv.ctxCancel()` call — exactly as the code-path analysis predicted, since nothing
exercised in the suite ever starts a goroutine keyed on `srv.ctx`. The change is still correct to keep:
it closes the same class of gap this PR already works around (Shutdown's `httpServer == nil` guard
skipping cleanup) for one more field, and it's a hedge against a future test exercising
`handleSystemImagesPull`/`Build` or any future code that binds a background goroutine to `srv.ctx`.

**Relationship to ptone/scion#2433:** this extends the same test-side workaround ptone/scion#2434
already applies to ptone/scion#2433's production gap (Shutdown's `httpServer`-nil guard) — previously
for the five Close/Stop calls, now also for `ctxCancel`. Not posted to ptone/scion#2433 directly per
instruction; noted here and in the report to the EM for them to relay if useful. No production code
was touched.
