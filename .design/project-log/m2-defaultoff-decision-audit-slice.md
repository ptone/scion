# M2 bounded authorization-audit merge checkpoint

Date: 2026-10-06 UTC. Workstream: ptone/scion#2379.

This checkpoint integrates the immutable selected-main baseline and resolves
the accepted authorization merge conflicts. Amendments 6–12 to the protected
default-off brief authorize this five-path compatibility slice and its durable
merge. It does not implement or activate the subsequent default-off router,
registry, admission, freshness, drain, health, or production cutover surfaces.

## Baseline and path accounting

- First parent: `dd44eed7b1c4d085765b0b3f42eafbbf5f90a0d5` (M2).
- Second parent: `48c3666ac5c39682f066b3473f0c3b17c12f73de` (selected-main).
- Merge base: `64a549c402fe941a9ea7702a453ecf60b0b70d94`.
- Selected-main contains #2502 merge
  `8767f43aeb8ada3fe2b2e05d78da14b8f3b4ba5b`.
- Provisional conflict merge tree:
  `a0b47f623b800ff0fe91f1ee7574a11978af0e0f`.
- The raw inherited manifest contains 2,492 rows / 100,577 bytes, SHA-256
  `a1d088a488d4071529201462fcccccffe60fdf9c72f6dfe2e8eb0c7b365be6c3`.
  It is preserved outside Git at the protected workstream reviews path as
  `m2-defaultoff-inherited-baseline-manifest.txt`. These are inherited baseline
  integration changes, not manual implementation scope. Moving-main drift was
  explicitly dispositioned without fetching or integrating the moving tip.

The five accepted manual paths are `pkg/hub/authz.go`,
`pkg/hub/authz_candelegate.go`, `pkg/hub/authz_bearer.go`,
`pkg/hub/authz_merge_conflict_test.go`, and
`pkg/hub/authz_audit_reason_test.go`. This project log is the sixth manual path.
All other merged changes remain the accepted provisional baseline content.

## Conflict decisions and compatibility repair

- H1 retains M2's operation-free evaluation request while carrying selected-main
  target evidence and bearer-run memo state. Ordinary Decide retains one audit
  emission; bearer introspection remains non-emitting. The internal bearer
  evaluation literal uses the operation-free request type.
- H2 preserves the selected-main constraint/relationship fault condition,
  authorization outcome, denial text, and resolution-error deny cause, and adds
  dependency-unavailable audit metadata.
- H3 preserves selected-main bearer boundary, permission ceiling, live project
  admission, target evidence, and memo behavior. Denied helper and direct
  stage-1 returns classify audit metadata using typed DenyCause: resolution
  errors are dependency-unavailable; other denials are policy-denied.
- H4 retains selected-main delegation signatures, guard order, target
  construction, project-admission arguments, denial text, and permission
  ceiling logic. Local denials use policy metadata. Typed project-access lookup
  faults use dependency metadata; every other error or refusal still denies.
- Amendment 9 corrected one existing audit-reason test call by supplying
  `context.Background()` to the context-first delegation signature. Assertions
  and fixtures were unchanged. This fifth path was separately diff-reviewed.

Stage A intentionally withheld H2–H4 final audit metadata to prove a meaningful
RED. Stage B changed only metadata in authz.go and authz_candelegate.go after
manager acceptance. No reason-string parsing or error-to-allow path was added.
The #2502 writer and metrics files remain byte-identical to selected-main.

## Focused RED and GREEN

The exact accepted RED command was:

```sh
HEAVY_BUILD_MAX_WAIT=2700 /scion-volumes/scratchpad/tools/heavy-build.sh sh -c '
available=$(free -g | awk '\''/^Mem:/ {print $7}'\'')
free -g
if [ -z "$available" ] || [ "$available" -lt 30 ]; then
  echo "MEMORY_GATE_BLOCKED_AT_ACQUIRE available=${available:-unknown}"
  exit 75
fi
ulimit -v 12000000
exec timeout 15m env GOMEMLIMIT=6GiB GOGC=40 GOFLAGS=-gcflags=-c=1 GOCACHE=/scion-volumes/gocache go test -timeout 14m -count=1 -p 1 -v ./pkg/hub -run '\''^(TestAuthzConflictResolution_OperationFreeBearerInputs|TestAuthzConflictResolution_FaultAuditReasons|TestAuthzConflictResolution_UATDelegationBoundaryAndFault)$'\''
'
```

Amendment-9 RED acquired slot-2 after 225 seconds; acquire-time available memory
was 45 GB. Exit 1, wall duration 832 seconds, package test duration 1.992 seconds.
H1 passed. All 15 failed assertions across 13 failing subtests were intended
H2–H4 AuditReason comparisons; three delegation pass cases passed. No unrelated
outcome/reason/cause, compilation, setup, resource, or timeout failure occurred.
Manager independently accepted this evidence.

The exact accepted GREEN command was:

```sh
HEAVY_BUILD_MAX_WAIT=2700 /scion-volumes/scratchpad/tools/heavy-build.sh sh -c '
available=$(free -g | awk '\''/^Mem:/ {print $7}'\'')
free -g
if [ -z "$available" ] || [ "$available" -lt 30 ]; then
  echo "MEMORY_GATE_BLOCKED_AT_ACQUIRE available=${available:-unknown}"
  exit 75
fi
ulimit -v 12000000
exec timeout 15m env GOMEMLIMIT=6GiB GOGC=40 GOFLAGS=-gcflags=-c=1 GOCACHE=/scion-volumes/gocache go test -timeout 14m -count=1 -p 1 -v ./pkg/hub -run '\''^(TestAuthzConflictResolution_OperationFreeBearerInputs|TestAuthzConflictResolution_FaultAuditReasons|TestAuthzConflictResolution_UATDelegationBoundaryAndFault|TestEvaluateBearerCeiling_MatchesUATRequestDecision|TestEvaluateBearerCeiling_EmitsNoDecisionAudit|TestEvaluateBearerCeiling_StoreFaultDenies|TestUATGate_HubBoundaryReachesAccessibleProjects|TestUATGate_ProjectTargetRequiresCurrentAccess|TestUATGate_RequestTargetEvidence|TestEvaluateBearerCeiling_EvidenceMustNameEvaluatedPermission|TestRelationshipProjectAccess_DecideRefusalIdentical|TestCanDelegate_UATCannotDelegateOutsideProject|TestCanDelegate_UATCannotCreateSystemGrants|TestAuthz_IsIndeterminate_AccessConstraintLoadError|TestExplainAPI_EffectivePermissionsUsesNonEmittingIntrospection|TestDecisionAudit_Sampling)$'\''
'
```

Amendment-11 GREEN acquired slot-1 immediately; acquire-time available memory
was 36 GB. Exit 0, wall duration 580 seconds, package result
`ok github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/scion/pkg/hub 6.519s`. All 16 named tests and
27 subtests passed, with no failure or skip. Amendment 12 independently accepts
this GREEN. No additional Go/build/vet/lint/race/full-suite execution is allowed.

The compile failure was the single context-first signature mismatch corrected
under Amendment 9. Every reattempt required explicit coordinator/manager
authority; no automatic retry or resource-cap enlargement occurred. Reports
1–3 and all evidence remain sealed outside Git.

## Remaining gates and non-activation

The fresh significant-conflict review is a separate manager-controlled gate
after durable push. No reviewer was started and explain round 7 was not used.
The subsequent registry/router/admission slice and its implementation map are
not authorized by this closeout. No production census or ratified positive
handler was supplied; no T1–T25 entry, SCC grounding, production acceptance,
clean-build/live-profile/trust/activation gate, monotonic freshness bridge,
bounded NEW drain, or decision-health projection is approved by these tests.
Production admission/cutover remains rejected pending those independent gates.
The finite fixtures prove merge compatibility only, not production trust.

No PR, main merge, deployment, experiment activation, live-setting change,
legacy retirement, logging/sink behavior change, or #2392 timing claim is part
of this checkpoint. Retained legacy #2502 lifecycle remains separate from the
unimplemented NEW 2-second drain. Human-directed questions sent by this worker:
none; manager acceptance exchanges are agent-directed. After delivery the worker
remains blocked pending durable receipt and explicit lifecycle disposition.

## Default-off vertical slice — accepted finite mechanics, 2026-10-06

Implementation base: `591e24c340fa9b0f68102a11c0c649a98749c58f`.
Amendments 13–23 separately authorize this slice after the compatibility
checkpoint described above. That earlier merge/conflict history is inherited
compatibility work, not this slice's implementation scope. The eleven final
implementation/test paths are:

```text
pkg/experiments/registry.go
pkg/experiments/registry_test.go
pkg/hub/audit_authz_test.go
pkg/hub/decision_audit_admission.go
pkg/hub/decision_audit_admission_test.go
pkg/hub/handlers_health.go
pkg/hub/handlers_health_summary_test.go
pkg/hub/handlers_health_test.go
pkg/hub/operational_settings.go
pkg/hub/operational_settings_test.go
pkg/hub/server.go
```

This log, `.design/project-log/m2-defaultoff-decision-audit-slice.md`, is the
single additional path. The slice preserves ordinary authorization results,
sampling, H1–H4, and the retained #2502 writer/metrics/legacy lifecycle. It adds
only the server-layer alpha experiment `hub.authorization_decision_audit_v2`,
registered default false, and bounded fail-closed local routing mechanics.

Finite admission validates the whole canonical manifest and exact live
root/legacy/handler/clock/timer/settings/caller graph; missing, extra, drifted,
unknown or over-cap facts reject wholesale. Expected positive constructor facts
are test-only. Successful authoritative read observations alone establish the
q0-based 74-second lease with one-second read slack in the approved 75-second
budget. Source/attachment/sequence/generation/revision/epoch and matching copied
snapshots must still agree at handoff; failed, canceled, overlapping, obsolete,
stale or unproved reads stay off. Wall time, events and cached true are not proof.

One stable router provides K=1 synchronous NEW ownership, with no queue or
hidden goroutine. Ineligible decisions choose legacy exactly once. An admitted
finite NEW failure/panic/nonacceptance/caller cancellation latches fault once;
the triggering record may be lost, with no same-record fallback/retry. The next
record chooses legacy. The admitted finite caller is live-bound before methods;
unproved/hostile or pre-canceled callers reject before NEW. Caller cancellation
during NEW is accounted on synchronous return, without parenting or a watcher.
Independent cooperative mechanics cancel at h+1 and complete/release by h+2;
this is separate from retained legacy's 4s+1s shutdown and HTTP drain behavior.

The locally readable NEW health fault is a critical audit/logging warning:
possible triggering-record loss, NEW off, subsequent legacy routing. It remains
latched independently of the failed sink. Historical legacy drops/closed state
have a separate fixed check. Only its Hub availability effect is noncritical:
health degrades while serving/readiness remain available, and existing truly
availability-critical failures still win. No broader dashboard delivery claim.

Accepted Stage-A RED: protected `reviews/m2-defaultoff-stage-a-seam-red-amendment-15.txt`,

`cee01061bfbae74761ca36072f07e592973f9b2cd6b8c451dc1a65158d0abbcb`.
Its three intended failures were the absent compiled registry entry, nil exact
finite admission, and NEW count 0 versus required 1 (legacy count 1). Prior
one-owner/result checks passed; no unrelated failure. It was not rerun.

Accepted Stage-B GREEN: protected `reviews/m2-defaultoff-stage-b-green-amendment-22.txt`,

`0fa4809e4df2e386945de88c9ee717dd575c886d2c423309a82094f289f6f95c`.
The exact literal command is sealed in that evidence: heavy-build wrapper,
`HEAVY_BUILD_MAX_WAIT=2700` (45-minute queue maximum), acquire-time available
memory >=30 GB, independent `timeout 15m`, `ulimit -v 12000000`,
`GOMEMLIMIT=6GiB`, `GOGC=40`, `GOFLAGS=-gcflags=-c=1`,
`GOCACHE=/scion-volumes/gocache`; targeted `go test -timeout 14m -count=1 -p 1 -v`
on `./pkg/experiments ./pkg/hub`, exact 35-name selector, no full suite/race.
The single invocation acquired slot 2 immediately at 47 GB available, exited 0
in 586.857204 seconds, and produced experiments `ok` (0.005s) and Hub `ok`
(3.902s). All 35 named tests and 112 subtests passed (147 matching RUN/PASS
outcomes), with no missing/unexpected/duplicate/skip/fail/timeout/setup/resource
result. This includes the live-caller mutation, hostile/unproved and pre-canceled
caller rejection, distinct post-handoff caller-cancel mode, and retained invariants.
No repair, retry, extra Go command or resource-cap enlargement followed.

Production NEW remains structurally unadmitted even with a fresh true override:
no ratified production census/manifest, exact live bindings, clean-build/live
profile, elapsed clock/timer, cooperative store/source, accepting handler,
originating caller or complete-return/cleanup contract is supplied. No T1–T25
entry, profile, imported target or trust boundary is approved by finite fixtures.
Independent critical warning/alert/dashboard-delivery proof remains a hard
pre-activation gate. These tests do not prove production persistence, no-loss,
freshness source, drain timing or sink health/alert delivery.

No activation, deployment, live-setting change, cutover, legacy retirement,
PR/main merge, reviewer launch or explain round 7 is authorized. Production
trust/census/live-profile/clock/store/handler/caller/complete-return/alert-delivery
and activation gates remain rejecting. At this log-review stage implementation
is staged, log unstaged, and commit/push remain held for manager disposition.
Earlier compatibility evidence and all sealed RED/GREEN/blocker artifacts are
preserved. Human-directed messages/questions from this worker: none. Lifecycle
completion/deletion remains held pending durable receipt and explicit release.

## Quality-gate corrections — finite mechanics only, 2026-10-06

Correction base: `5ea96416729ccd739d3a4bbd9809026d9498001a`.
Amendments 25–32 authorize this bounded correction checkpoint. The independent
input verdicts were code REQUEST CHANGES, test REQUEST CHANGES, and security
APPROVE exclusively for the bounded default-off posture. Security approval
waived none of the code or test findings and granted no production admission.
Protected reports under the workstream reviews directory are:

Code H1 required persistent propagation-lifecycle rejection; M1/M2 required real
lower-authoritative-revision and otherwise-eligible live ownership fixtures.
Test F1–F5 required causal K=1/concurrent handoff, independent h+1 cancellation
and h+2/+1ns completion, occupied NEW close/cancel/wait/reference cleanup and
HTTP drain, authoritative revision regression, and isolated safety boundaries.
A27 adds these finite oracles only in the two existing test paths. Manifest
cardinality coverage truthfully proves seven accepted roles/eight rejected; the
16-entry ceiling is redundant/unreachable in this schema, not tested at 16/17.
Virtual-clock boundaries do not prove real scheduler or arbitrary-I/O bounds.

A28's single accepted expanded RED produced five failing subcases and ten
assertion errors: stop, channel-close, recovered-loop and stop-during-read each
failed two lifecycle assertions; sequence exhaustion failed both the in-read
ownership assertion and persistent poisoned-observation assertion. The tenth
assertion was independently classified as the second manifestation of the same
sequence defect. No RED rerun or automatic repair followed. Protected raw:
`m2-defaultoff-quality-gate-red-amendment-28.txt`, 1,205 lines / 125,624 bytes,
SHA-256 `fab127694a414e678650b59fb16d87076bbeacdfece14f0298a0d435b7eb1628`.

A29 production corrections are confined to decision_audit_admission.go and
operational_settings.go. A gate-owned per-attachment propagation-loss latch
rejects new reads, publication and both candidate/final NEW handoff. Propagation
start, polling, reconnect, subscription exit/recovery and stop carry a captured
router/source/attachment identity; callbacks from an old attachment cannot
clear a current proof. Only explicit source attachment handoff clears the
attachment's lifecycle loss. Refresh poison, clock poison and fault stay latched.
Sequence exhaustion atomically sets poison and empties the router observation;
no successful read can revive it. Refresh completion publishes or clears the
copied Ops proof only for its current attachment. Lock acquisition stays
OperationalSettings.mu -> router.gate, with no reverse acquisition.

A30 corrects only the frozen sequence-exhaustion fixture predicate: it requires
an already-empty router observation and uses the copied Ops proof as the
otherwise-eligible stale baseline before the poisoned emission. Ownership and
persistent-poison assertions are unchanged. This tests the combined atomic
clearing/poison invariant; it does not isolate removal of the poison guard alone.
Lifecycle slot cancellation executes outside both locks. Refresh completion
cancellation executes outside router.gate but still under OperationalSettings.mu,
preserving the preexisting refresh completion behavior; error completion now
uses the same mu -> gate publication ordering. No parent watcher, new goroutine,
queue, exported positive constructor or production trust adapter was added.

A31's single literal 35-name focused GREEN acquired heavy-build slot 4 after

The exact command is preserved in the protected A30 review and A31 raw evidence:
normal heavy-build wrapper, HEAVY_BUILD_MAX_WAIT=2700 (45m queue), acquire-time
available memory >=30 GB, ulimit -v 12000000, GOMEMLIMIT=6GiB, GOGC=40,

literal 35-name selector. No outer timeout, second invocation, retry, race,
full suite, build, vet, lint, generator or resource-cap enlargement followed.

Production NEW remains structurally unadmitted and the registered experiment
remains default false, including under a fresh true production override. Every
hard pre-activation gate remains rejecting: ratified production census and exact
whole manifest; T1–T25/SCC/provenance/constructor authority; clean source/build
and exact live profile/capture/bindings for root, legacy, handler, clock, timer,
settings and originating caller; monotonic elapsed clock/suspension/epoch and
timer scheduler; bounded cooperative authoritative store/source; accepting
handler; complete synchronous cancellation/return/reference cleanup graph;
independent critical audit-warning, alert and dashboard delivery; production
freshness/drain/persistence/no-loss evidence and explicit activation approval.
Finite fixture GREEN supplies none of those production contracts or approvals.
The retained #2502 legacy lifecycle and ordinary authorization/sampling/results
remain separate from finite NEW mechanics.

Fresh post-fix independent re-review is still pending. No final quality-gate
approval, reviewer launch, activation, deployment, live-setting change, cutover,
legacy retirement, main merge, PR or explain round 7 is claimed. This checkpoint
contains exactly four correction paths plus this appended project log. Earlier
history is preserved byte-for-byte, and all sealed reports/evidence stay outside
Git unchanged. Human-directed messages/questions from this worker: none.
Completion/deletion remains held for durable receipt, independent re-review and
explicit lifecycle disposition.

## Fresh test-review closure — bounded fixture correction, 2026-10-07

Checkpoint base: `2d11b29bbdefdff419b76d7d245ca7c4419759fb`.
Fresh independent code review APPROVE and security review APPROVE apply only
to the bounded default-off correction. Fresh test review REQUEST CHANGES for
R1 High (recovered-loop masking by stop cleanup) and R2 Medium (missing actual
captured-attachment publication coverage); neither approval waived those items.

A33 changes only operational_settings_test.go. R1 now asserts the real recovered
subscription path's persistent loss after unsubscribe completion and BEFORE the
independent stop cleanup closure: loss already latched, both copied/router proofs
wholly empty, healthy same-attachment Refresh unable to revive either proof,
and exactly one legacy/zero NEW owner. Only then stop/join the poll goroutine.
The obsolete cleanup comment is corrected. Existing stop/channel-close/read-stop
assertions and the later explicit handoff recovery remain separate and intact.

R2 adds four finite actual OperationalSettings captured-A callbacks after explicit
same-source handoff to fresh B: loss, successful read completion, store-error
completion, and rejected/untracked read completion. Each requires full copied
Ops/router B proof equality and exactly one NEW/zero legacy owner. Current B loss
then invalidates both proofs and healthy same-attachment reads remain legacy-only;
only explicit C handoff and fresh captured C read recover finite NEW ownership.
Tracked A success/error setup releases only A's old pending router bookkeeping
before real B publication, then resumes the ORIGINAL A Ops completion. That
preparatory router call is not the publication oracle and proves no availability
with an outstanding tracked-old read. Same-valued generic cache ingestion keeps
private publication ownership separate from snapshot mismatch. No production
source, top-level test name, selector, arbitrary callback or timing bound changed.

A34's single literal focused GREEN began 2026-10-06 23:42:18.740425Z and ended
23:58:05.282848Z, wall 946.542528 seconds including queue. Slot 4 acquired after

Exit 0: experiments PASS 0.006s, Hub PASS 8.897s. Exact stable census: 35 named

It began before the broker pause and continued alone under the explicit

A34 accepted one disclosed nonsemantic reading-order exception for A33 only:
all four required input identities matched before edits, security contained no
corrective direction, its complete body was read before delivery, and the exact

recorded in the validation evidence; this exception is not generalized or repeated.

Production files remain unchanged. NEW remains structurally unadmitted and the
registered experiment remains default false, including fresh true override.
All earlier hard pre-activation gates remain rejecting: ratified census/manifest,
T1–T25/SCC/provenance/constructor authority, clean build/live profile and exact
binding/capture graph, elapsed clock/timer/scheduler, cooperative store/handler/
originating caller, complete stop/return/cleanup, independent critical warning/
alert/dashboard delivery, production freshness/drain/persistence/no-loss and
explicit activation/cutover approval. Finite GREEN grants no trust, activation,
deployment, cutover, persistence, production timing, alert delivery, legacy
retirement, PR/main merge or explain round 7 claim. Existing #2502 legacy
lifecycle, authorization outcomes and sampling remain separate and unchanged.

Commit/push and fresh independent test re-review remain pending. This log append

## 2026-10-07 — isolated publication integration closeout (append acceptance pending)

Worker audit-update-m2-defaultoff-publish-dev-1; manager audit-update-em.
This section records the isolated publication preparation checkpoint. All prior
419 lines / 27,053 bytes remain an identical historical prefix, SHA-256
9178af154ba4a32ba8f82e9a35a7135beaea63a7b61b56c66547ace5c5e152e7.
Historical staging/push/re-review wording above describes its original phases;
the current state is recorded below without rewriting those checkpoints.

Immutable main integration base: d8b2b692b1ff9c69812838ae67c1d052ab180b22.
Selected-main #2502 writer/emitter substrate:
48c3666ac5c39682f066b3473f0c3b17c12f73de.
Accepted finite slice/correction provenance chain:

6d6e4de4598c82f0579fb0c566ea422c7e997b29.
The local publication branch is scion/audit-update-m2-defaultoff-publish.

Only the approved eleven code/test deltas and exact final historical log were
extracted onto pinned main, exactly twelve paths. The whole M2 branch, its
34-path historical merge payload and 448-path whole-branch delta are excluded.
Seven historical operationId additions in audit_authz_test.go were excluded;
only the two approved router tests were added. The three absent historical
TestAuthzConflictResolution_OperationFreeBearerInputs,
TestAuthzConflictResolution_FaultAuditReasons and
TestAuthzConflictResolution_UATDelegationBoundaryAndFault tests were not imported
or selected, and their historical outcomes are not claimed on current main.

Current-main health response shape, stall_config omission, plugin broker
exclusion/pagination and server context are retained. The exact approved summary
warning test was inserted before main's plugin tests, relocating only a blank
separator around its unchanged body. Approved health/server hooks were applied
with context offsets; no newly authored production adaptation or API bridge.
Selected #2502 legacy writer/emitter ownership, sampling/authorization results,
HTTP drain and separate legacy close/deferred-close behavior remain intact.

Stage-A protected packet, under
/scion-volumes/scratchpad/projects/audit-update/reviews/:

Stage A accounted for twelve postimages, 3,136 additions / 8 deletions. Eight
postimages, including the historical log, equal exact final approved blobs;
four retain main context. Exact approved-hunk reversal restores main bytes;
all 32 other historical paths remain unchanged or absent on both sides.
Scoped gofmt changed zero bytes; diff-check and protected-patch checks passed.
The Stage-A packet remains sealed as the pre-append checkpoint, not this append.

The private shallow clone initially lacked five literal provenance objects.
Amendment 1 authorized exactly five one-shot depth-1 SHA fetches, in order:
48c3666, 591e24c, 5ea9641, 2d11b29, 6d6e4de (full identities above).
All succeeded; only object storage, FETCH_HEAD and inherent shallow-boundary
bookkeeping changed. Main/task refs, origin/config, index and worktree stayed
unchanged during provisioning. Literal commit identities and raw ordered/sole
parents were verified. Main remained shallow, so local ancestry checking was
unavailable (exit 1); no deepen, retry or shallow repair occurred. Amendment 2
accepted the manager's successful immutable ancestry proof sealed in
m2-defaultoff-publication-footprint.md, SHA-256
6ab094d2d748de0b44851d6bf29daf84ef9e6efed6a84f97778a66cd7270b0a6:
selected-main is an ancestor of pinned main and their merge base is selected-main.
The narrow reviewer accepted that sealed provenance; it fetched no historical
objects and did not claim independent local historical-object availability.

Current-main Amendment-3 focused GREEN ran exactly once, without retry/repair.

Its scope is retention of this exact isolated Stage A and truthful log closeout;

Neither approval supplies a new full-M2/code/security/full-CI/race approval or

## 2026-10-07 — GoogleCloudPlatform/scion#2774 immutable-c885 forward merge

This checkpoint records the accepted bounded forward-merge resolution and one
focused GREEN. It does not record a merge commit, push, PR conflict clearance,
CI result, fresh review approval, or production activation.

Publication HEAD/ORIG_HEAD and prospective first parent:
aaae9bc62e4819151ec044c4dd5013d0fd2bd58f.
Pending MERGE_HEAD and prospective second parent:
c885fe2aeeb5bc7433079e902e905c8d547ec702.
Independently verified exact merge base:
d8b2b692b1ff9c69812838ae67c1d052ab180b22.
Original M2/live fork ref remains:
6d6e4de4598c82f0579fb0c566ea422c7e997b29.
Forward merge only; no rebase or force. No newer moving main was chased.

Provisioning was explicitly released in bounded amendments. Amendment1 fetched
base d8b2b692b1ff9c69812838ae67c1d052ab180b22 from origin with --no-tags --depth=1,
then upstream 3aab0d4b1e26e7a8c1d9f3db9844fb6d38c066bc with --no-tags --depth=1
from https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/scion.git. Amendment2 fetched literal
c885fe2aeeb5bc7433079e902e905c8d547ec702 once from that URL with --no-tags --depth=1.
Those maps used the specified base honestly while shallow boundaries hid deeper
ancestry; no traversed merge-base equality was claimed then. Amendment3 ran once,
in order:
- git fetch --no-tags --deepen=1 origin aaae9bc62e4819151ec044c4dd5013d0fd2bd58f
- git fetch --no-tags --depth=10000 https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/scion.git c885fe2aeeb5bc7433079e902e905c8d547ec702
The authorized bookkeeping replaced four boundaries with three older ones, then
removed the remaining shallow file. Exact merge-base traversal now returned d8.
Every fetch exited 0; permitted effects were objects, FETCH_HEAD and inherent
shallow bookkeeping. Ref/config/index/worktree preflight invariants held.
Ordinary GIT_EDITOR=true git merge --no-ff --no-commit c885fe2aeeb5bc7433079e902e905c8d547ec702
ran once and produced exactly the two mapped content conflicts.

Base-to-c885 changes: 634 paths, four publication overlaps, two conflicts,
changed-path union 642. The accepted authored ceiling is exactly thirteen:
the original twelve plus only pkg/hub/perftrace_integration_test.go.
The other 629 upstream changed paths are inherited-only, including deletions.
All 6848 other current tree entries match exact c885 mode/blob. No path14 or
excluded whole-M2/34-path historical merge/448-path branch payload was imported;
seven historical operationId additions and three historical conflict tests remain
excluded. The original 543-line/34994-byte log prefix remains byte-for-byte.

C1 retained both independent OperationalSettings field groups with comments:
the audit observer/observation/mutation fields and c885 remoteImagesWarnedRev;
all c885 Artifacts warning behavior and atomic import remain.
C2 composes outer perf decorator -> stable decision-audit router -> exact concrete
legacy writer. Concrete writer field identity, upstream perf logger/warning,
single ctx/record forwarding, counting/timing, writer metrics and separate HTTP
drain/deferred legacy-close ownership remain. Production constructor populates
only legacy/server; admission, contract handler and clock remain nil.
The perftrace constructor fixture retains the concrete-writer type assertion at
router.legacy and checks exact retained writer identity, off-mode exact router/
decorator transparency, on-mode decorator.next == exact router, and nil admission/
handler/clock in both modes. Existing store/default/logger/header/log/response/
count assertions are preserved. Scoped formatting and staging affected only the
three directly resolved/edited Go paths. Finite proof blobs remain unchanged.

No source/test repair, retry or second Go invocation occurred. No Go/compiler/test/

worktree and protected evidence stayed unchanged after the invocation.

This GREEN proves only focused immutable-c885 integration mechanics. Mandatory
fresh narrow review remains pending because C2 is significant/newly composed
non-test behavior. Commit, push, upstream PR conflict clearance and CI remain
pending and unclaimed. No reviewer or agent was started by this worker.
Amendment5 releases only this append, its protected evidence, scoped diff-check,
and staging of the exact log; durability requires separate disposition.

Production NEW remains default false and structurally unadmitted even with a true

complete-return/alert/freshness/drain/persistence/no-loss/activation gate remains
rejecting, including constructor/live-build/provenance/SCC/suspension/timer/
scheduler/cleanup/dashboard gates. No deploy, cutover, legacy retirement, full-M2,
full-CI, race or explain-round-7 claim is made.

Mutation inventory: explicitly authorized SHA provisioning/connectivity, one
pending forward merge, mapped apply_patch resolutions, scoped gofmt/stage, one
wrapped focused invocation and evidence, then log-only append/evidence/stage.
No ref/config repair, rebase/force, commit/push, PR comment, reviewer/agent creation,
admission, activation or deployment. Human questions: NONE. Agent-directed manager
exchanges remain separate. Retain and BLOCK for exact append acceptance and

## 2026-10-07 — PR #2774 mechanical lint fixes and bounded validation closeout

Base HEAD/local/tracking/live publication is
`be96a1d1807e8af27d260c4563c98743e0511f79` on
`scion/audit-update-m2-defaultoff-publish`; divergence is 0/0. Original live M2
remains `6d6e4de4598c82f0579fb0c566ea422c7e997b29`. This entry records the
Amendments 7–10 correction packet for the three upstream lint findings on PR
#2774. Commit, push and a new upstream CI run are still pending.

The upstream findings were errcheck at
`pkg/hub/decision_audit_admission_test.go:786:26` for unchecked
`response.Body.Close`, staticcheck QF1011 at `pkg/hub/audit_authz_test.go:851:15`
for the redundant `context.Context` declaration, and unused at
`pkg/hub/operational_settings.go:1902:31` for
`(*OperationalSettings).invalidateDecisionAuditObservation`.

The exact mechanical correction paths are:

- `pkg/hub/audit_authz_test.go`: replace the redundant explicitly typed
  `context.Context` local initialized by `context.Background()` with inferred
  `caller := context.Background()`; the context and test assertions are unchanged.
- `pkg/hub/decision_audit_admission_test.go`: assign `response.Body.Close()` to
  existing `requestErr` on the successful request branch. The existing completion
  synchronization and error assertion observe the close result; ownership,
  timing, counts and assertions are preserved.
- `pkg/hub/operational_settings.go`: delete only unused
  `invalidateDecisionAuditObservation`. Whole-repository hidden-file search
  excluding `.git` and tracked-file search each found only its declaration and
  zero references before deletion; both found zero occurrences afterward.
  Neighboring methods are unchanged. Removing unreachable code changes no
  production behavior. Scoped formatting introduced no incidental changes.

`b951814d8fb6b56f17adebca388baec9896b61b1`. Exact merge base is
`c885fe2aeeb5bc7433079e902e905c8d547ec702`; publication HEAD/ORIG_HEAD remain
`54bfc9559ce8f4824d9be7ca6174ac2c8fff583a`, with pending MERGE_HEAD exact b951.
No moving-main query or chase occurred after the recovered pin was frozen.
GoogleCloudPlatform/scion#2782 is separately owned and inherited, outside
PR #2774 authored scope: `pkg/hub/handlers_agents_core.go` is exact upstream
blob `70a6e59339e3c82bfc3de37bf9c9c56bdbd96485`, and line 2629 passes `s.store`
to `dispatchDeleteFailedCreate`. No local repair was copied or authored.

The bounded connectivity history remains truthful and preserved. Amendment 12
stopped after a truncated pin-capture output; Amendment 13 recovered the exact
pin and authorized one literal depth-1 b951 fetch, then stopped on absent raw
parent `05df386e4e0b67d3a3b3bfbff425a176b04582e7` and merge-base exit 1.
Amendment 14 authorized one literal depth-8 parent fetch; the nine raw commits
from c885 through b951 were proved, but b951 remained shallow and merge-base
still returned 1. Amendment 15 authorized one literal depth-9 b951 fetch;
b951 ceased to be shallow and merge-base returned exact c885. Each fetch used
`--no-tags` and literal `https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/scion.git`, once,
without retry, moving ref, manual shallow edit, deepen, unshallow or ref/config
repair. Earlier stops were not rewritten or relabeled successful maps.
All Amendment 12–15 blocker/map artifacts remain unchanged and protected.

The accepted Amendment 15 non-writing `merge-tree --trivial-merge` map ran once:
zero conflicts, two clean/noninterfering overlaps, exactly 13 existing authored
paths and 6,862 inherited paths of 6,875 entries. `server.go` takes the inherited
upstream rollback call's store argument; `handlers_health_summary_test.go`
inherits upstream health-schema/test updates and retains the same 28-line
decision-audit warning fixture. No path 14, additional authored dependency,
API, behavior or scope expansion was required. Full map evidence is

Amendment 16 released one ordinary `git merge --no-ff --no-commit` of exact b951.
It exited 0 with automatic merging of the two overlaps, zero conflicts and no
manual resolution/edit/format/staging. Pending candidate tree is
`ab2d213e8932e1f98fb40cd6565020b4fdfe253c`; the full staged inventory matches the
map exactly: 13 authored paths against b951 and 6,862 exact inherited entries.

Postflight preserved exact pending metadata, index/tree/postimages, all working
blobs, 13 authored/6,862 inherited paths, refs, repair and all protected evidence;
no unstaged/unmerged/untracked entry or surviving task process preceded this append.

Local lint remains INCONCLUSIVE (the sole prior invocation exited 124 during
compilation), never GREEN, with no retry now or later. This focused GREEN cannot
clear lint. Merge commit, normal push, new authoritative upstream CI and readiness
remain pending; upstream lint and required checks must be GREEN after push.
The previous fresh local review applies only to be96, not a later merge SHA.
No new reviewer or readiness claim is made by this log entry.

Production NEW remains default false and structurally unadmitted. The private
fixture-only positive contract, outer performance decorator, stable router,
exact legacy writer ownership and close/drain mechanics remain unchanged.
No trust, admission, activation, deployment, persistence, timing, alerting,
cutover, legacy retirement, full-M2 or explain-round-7 gate is opened or claimed.

Mutation inventory: exact bounded connectivity fetches and protected map packets;
one authorized ordinary pending merge, one wrapped focused invocation and its
three protected artifacts; this single additions-only log append and two
protected log artifacts. No manual source/test correction, retry, lint rerun,
formatting, additional staging, log staging, commit, push, PR/reviewer/agent
action, moving-main chase, ref/config repair, rebase/force, original-M2 update,
production admission/activation/deployment/cutover/retirement. Human questions:
NONE; agent-directed manager reports are separate. The accepted pending index
is unchanged; this log is the sole unstaged path. Retain and BLOCK for log
acceptance/durability disposition; never task-complete or self-delete.
