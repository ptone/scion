# Hybrid Deployment Tier — Phase 3b: pod CIDR, hub-deny rule, static internal IP

Branch `scion/hybrid-tier-p3`, same fork PR as the earlier Phase 3a and 3b slices.

## Overview

Provisions pod CIDR discovery, a third firewall rule (hub-deny) that blocks the cluster's pod
range from reaching the hub VM's tcp:8080 directly, and a static internal IP reservation for the
hub VM so the shared NFS PV's server field stays stable across VM recreates. Agents reach the hub
through its existing public IAP URL; there is no private-IP hub endpoint.

## Pod CIDR discovery

`hybrid_discover` also reads the cluster's pod CIDR from the same cluster-describe call already
used for the node subnet: `clusterIpv4Cidr`, cross-checked against
`ipAllocationPolicy.clusterIpv4CidrBlock`. Discovery fails if either field is missing, if the two
disagree, or if the agreed value doesn't pass the same IPv4/`/8`-or-narrower validation already
used for the node subnet — never guessing between two different answers, and never handing a
dangerously broad range to the firewall rule below.

## Hub-deny firewall rule

A third rule, `scion-hub-<hub>-hub-deny` (`INGRESS DENY tcp:8080` from the discovered pod CIDR,
priority 950 — the same scheme as `nfs-deny`, so it beats a network's own default-allow-internal
rule), joins the existing NFS allow/deny pair under the same target tag and marker convention.
Nothing in the cluster's pod range can reach the hub VM's tcp:8080 directly; only the cluster's
default pod range is covered, and a node pool with a separate pod CIDR isn't in scope (fails
closed, not open). `hybrid_teardown_check` classifies and reports on this third rule the same way
as the NFS pair; the underlying preflight/delete functions needed no changes, since they already
iterate generically over whatever names are classified.

## Static internal IP reservation

`scion-hub-<hub>-internal-ip` reserves the hub VM's internal address so it survives a VM recreate,
marked with an exact `scion-deployment=<hub>` description -- the same token format the firewall
rules, router, and service account use for their own markers. This marker is checked on every
adopt and every teardown: an address with this name that lacks it is refused on create and blocks
teardown. On a fresh VM, a free address is reserved (or an existing marked one reused) and the VM is created
with `--private-network-ip` pinned to it. On an existing VM, its current internal IP is promoted
into a reservation of the same name (`addresses create --addresses=<current-ip>`), and the VM is
re-described afterward to confirm the IP didn't change. A same-name reservation that's unmarked, or
marked but pointing at a different IP than the VM's actual one, fails the run with the mismatch and
remediation — never auto-corrected, matching the existing firewall-rule drift behavior.

Teardown checks this reservation the same way as the firewall rules: found-and-marked queues it for
delete, found-and-unmarked aborts the whole teardown before anything is deleted, and an
inconclusive check (a `list` failure) is never read as "gone." The reservation is deleted only once
the VM is positively confirmed gone project-wide — it's still attached to the VM's network
interface until then, so an earlier delete would fail regardless — and is reported as kept, with
the reason, rather than silently dropped from the summary when the VM's fate isn't confirmed.
`deploy.sh`'s VM-deletion branch was widened so an internal-IP reservation queued for delete
triggers the same strict, project-wide "confirmed gone" check the firewall rules already required,
not just a bare `describe` in a possibly-wrong zone.

## Internal IP guard

The pre-create half of the guard is structural: pod-CIDR discovery and the address reservation
already `exit 1` on their own failures before deploy.sh does anything else, so nothing downstream
of them runs on bad inputs. `hybrid_internal_ip_guard_verify`, called right after VM creation, is
the post-create half: it re-describes the address reservation and fails, naming what's missing or
mismatched, rather than letting deploy.sh proceed with settings.yaml or the rest of Phase 3 on an
incomplete guarantee.

## Hardening pass

A follow-up pass tightened several areas beyond the initial slice:

- **NFS server posture**: the `nfs.conf.d` drop-in now also disables NFSv4.0; `nfs-server` is
  restarted (not just enabled) after writing it, since a package install can already have started
  the service with stock config; the rpcbind mask is verified rather than assumed.
- **Loop filesystem**: image reservation uses `fallocate` (fails clearly, and removes the partial
  file, on insufficient disk) instead of a sparse `truncate`; a stale `/etc/fstab` line for the
  image with different options is refused rather than silently trusted; the mount is verified to
  actually be backed by the image's loop device, not just present at the export path; a
  `scion-hub.service` drop-in adds `RequiresMountsFor` on the export root. `x-systemd.required-by=`
  alone already keeps a failed mount from blocking boot (verified against `systemd.mount(5)`);
  `nofail` is kept only as a defensive redundancy.
- **Teardown clarity**: the internal IP reservation appears in the pre-delete confirmation list; the
  summary distinguishes "SKIPPED" (delete never attempted, with why) from "Kept" (delete attempted
  and failed); every base resource's "not found" case is now reported separately from "Kept" rather
  than collapsed into it.
- **Static IP / guard hardening**: the reused reservation's address type and subnet are checked
  against expectations on both the new-VM and existing-VM paths; a reservation create that succeeds
  but can't be read back is an explicit, named error instead of a silent `set -e` exit; the
  existing-VM promote path validates the current IP looks like IPv4 before using it; the internal
  IP guard checks the reservation's marker and that its address matches the VM's resolved internal
  IP.
- **Test harness**: the suite's own `TMPDIR` usage is now bounded to a single run-scoped directory,
  removed in one shot on exit, with a self-check that it's empty afterward; the create-mode wiring
  tests wait on a sentinel with a large timeout and fail loudly if it's never reached, instead of a
  fixed short grace period; substantial new coverage closes several gaps in the existing test
  suite, including: the NFS squash-identity script executed (not just its rendered text inspected); a
  host-bits-set CIDR rejection; each PV drift field (reclaim policy, `claimRef.name`,
  `claimRef.namespace`, path) checked individually in both the pre-VM and post-VM object checks; an
  unknown (not just absent) check result treated as a hard failure at every namespace/PV/PVC lookup
  site, including in teardown; a realistic kubectl permission-denied message that also matches the
  literal not-found shape; the Cloud Run proxy's marker label actually reaching the `run deploy`
  call; and every field of the hub-deny firewall rule's drift check (not just its source range).

## Test harness

`tests/lib/harness.sh` gained `seed_pod_cidr`/`seed_pod_cidr_mismatch`/`seed_pod_cidr_missing`,
`seed_address`/`seed_address_unmarked`, and `set_address_delete_will_fail`/
`set_address_list_will_fail`; `seed_cluster`'s generated fixture now includes a default,
mutually-agreeing pod CIDR so existing tests didn't need to change. `tests/lib/gcloud` gained
`compute addresses describe/create/delete/list` handlers. New coverage in `test_hybrid_tier.sh`
spans pod CIDR discovery, all four static-IP paths (new-VM reserve/reuse/refuse/list-error,
existing-VM promote/reuse/drift/refuse, teardown check/delete), and the internal IP guard; new
`test_deploy_wiring.sh` cases cover the actual deploy.sh-level wiring for the reservation's
teardown delete (unmarked-aborts, deleted-when-gone, kept-when-not-gone, ordering after the VM
delete), mirroring the existing pattern for the NFS firewall rules.
