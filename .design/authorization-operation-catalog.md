## schedule.event.create

**Bearer:** `session_only` (reason `GOV_PENDING`)

**Base Permission:** `scheduled_event.create`

**Resource Resolver:** project-from-url

**Effects:** `create-resource`, `grant-authority`

### Delegation

- **Kind:** `non_amplification`
- Only the dispatch_agent event type grants authority. Authoring any event type records the author's frozen effect ceiling (revisionAuthorityCeiling); a dispatch_agent event or schedule then creates an agent at fire time, with a delegation edge from the recorded principal, after CanDelegate for that principal. A message event or schedule grants no authority. Effects are listed per operation, not per event type, so grant-authority is listed for the whole operation

### Audit

- **Event Type:** `agent_delegation`
- **Context Fields:** actor_id
- **After Fields:** agent_id, can_delegate_result
- **Atomic:** No
- **Non-Atomic Justification:** The authoring write records no mutation audit record: it stores the initiator attribution and the frozen effect ceiling on the event or schedule row in the same insert. The agent_delegation record is written when a dispatch_agent event fires, in the agent-create transaction with the agent row and its delegation edge. A message event writes none
