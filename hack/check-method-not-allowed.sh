# Flags bare MethodNotAllowed(w) calls in pkg/hub and pkg/runtimebroker. A 405
# response MUST carry an Allow header (RFC 9110 section 15.5.6); both
# packages' MethodNotAllowed helpers set it from their variadic
# allowedMethods argument, so a call with no methods sends a 405 without
# Allow (ptone/scion#2421, PR #1413).
#
# Matches "MethodNotAllowed(w)" anywhere on a line, not only at line end, so
# `return MethodNotAllowed(w) // ...` or a call inside a larger expression is
# still caught. Test files are excluded: they may exercise the bare call on
# purpose.
#
# Severity: SECURITY-GRADE exit-code handling (fail-closed). This is a
# correctness check, not a security one, but it is blocking in CI, so an
# empty scan must not read as clean.
#   Missing tool:      exit 3 (nothing analysed; see hack/lib/require-tool.sh)
#   Missing scan root: exit 4 (a root directory does not exist, e.g. it was
#                      renamed; checked before scanning so a partial scan
#                      cannot read as clean)
#   No candidates:     exit 4 (no MethodNotAllowed call found at all, which
#                      means the scan roots are wrong, not that the tree is
#                      clean)
#   Violations found:  exit 1 (file:line list on stderr)
#   Clean:             exit 0
