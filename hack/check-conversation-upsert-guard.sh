# Guard: no conversation row may be minted outside the messaging layer
# (pkg/messaging/) and the store layer (pkg/store/).
#
# The property this guard enforces is: "no conversation is minted outside the
# messaging layer." It is NOT a function-name check — it is an enumeration of
# every code path that can INSERT a row into the conversations table or modify
# the participant listing index.
#
# Conversation-minting surface (enumerated 2026-08-27, Option C added 2026-08-29):
#
#   Go method calls (must only appear in pkg/messaging/ and pkg/store/):
#     1.  UpsertConversationByExternalRef — the primary resolve-or-create path
#     2a. CreateConversation              — direct INSERT (no production callers
#                                           today, but the method is public)
#     2b. AddParticipant                  — modifies the participant listing
#                                           index; an unguarded call outside
#                                           the resolve flow corrupts
#                                           conversation visibility
#
#   Ent builder (must only appear in pkg/store/):
#     3. .Conversation.Create()         — raw ent builder; only used inside
#                                         pkg/store/entadapter/conversation_store.go
#
#   Raw SQL INSERT INTO conversations (must only appear in pkg/store/):
#     4. INSERT [OR IGNORE|OR REPLACE] INTO ["]conversations["]
#                                       — case-insensitive match for the full
#                                         INSERT family. SQLite uses OR IGNORE
#                                         for idempotent inserts; Postgres uses
#                                         ON CONFLICT ... DO NOTHING (same line).
#
#   EXEMPTION (Option C, tranche C): pkg/hub/webchannel_store.go and
#   pkg/hub/webchannel_store_postgres.go may contain raw INSERT INTO
#   conversations when the statement mints kind='group'. These files perform
#   an atomic topic+conversation dual-write inside an explicit tx; the store
#   methods take ctx, not tx, so they cannot participate in the webchat
#   transaction. Surfaces 1, 2a, 2b, and 3 remain fully barred in pkg/hub.
#
# Test files (*_test.go) are excluded: test fixtures legitimately call store
# methods to set up state. The guard protects production code paths.
#
# Enumeration method: grep -rn for each pattern across all .go files, then
# subtract the allowed packages. If a new minting surface is added to the
# store interface, it must be added to this guard.
#
# LIMITATIONS
# This guard is textual and line-oriented. It does NOT detect:
#   - SQL split across lines (e.g., "INSERT INTO\n    conversations ...")
#   - A table name supplied through a format verb or variable
#     (e.g., fmt.Sprintf("INSERT INTO %s ...", tbl))
# Both are low-risk in practice: every existing INSERT site in this codebase
# puts "INSERT INTO conversations" on a single line (house style), and no
# site constructs the table name dynamically. But a green gate from this
# script guarantees only that the enumerated textual patterns are absent
# outside the allowed packages — it is not a proof that no mint path exists.
#   - The Option C exemption is textual: it extracts the SQL statement
#     (from the INSERT line through the closing backtick of the Go raw
#     string literal) and requires 'group' to appear in that text while
#     rejecting any other kind literal ('direct', 'channel', 'support').
#     A kind value supplied through a variable (e.g., kindVar instead of
#     'group') defeats the exemption check and will be rejected by the
#     guard even if the variable always holds "group" at runtime. This is
#     deliberate — the guard cannot verify runtime values, so it requires
#     the literal.
#
# Note: the default fallback for unknown conversation kinds uses
# requireParticipant, making the participant table an ACL for any future
# kind someone forgets to case. The guard therefore protects both
# listing-index integrity and, indirectly, access control for unhandled kinds.
