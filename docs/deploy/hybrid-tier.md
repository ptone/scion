# Hybrid Deployment Tier (VM Hub + Docker Broker + GKE Target + NFS)

## Overview

The hybrid tier extends the [Single-Node VM deployment](single-node-vm.md) with a
second place to run agents: a GKE cluster (`gke` runtime profile), alongside the
VM's existing co-located Docker broker. Both runtimes share project scratchpads
through `server.shared_dir_storage: nfs` — a new, decoupled-from-workspaces
setting that points both the Docker bind mount and the Kubernetes PVC `subPath`
at the same NFS-served directory tree on the VM.

This tier keeps the single-node hub's SQLite store and its Docker broker
unchanged. It adds:

- an NFS export (`knfsd`) served from a plain directory on the VM's boot disk;
- a second broker runtime profile, `type: kubernetes`, pointed at the GKE
  cluster;
- one static `PersistentVolume`/`PersistentVolumeClaim` pair in the agent
  namespace, applied once by the operator (or, in Phase 3, by `deploy.sh`).

**This tier requires a co-located broker**: the VM's Docker broker process
must have direct local filesystem access to the NFS export (i.e. it can
`stat` the resolved host base itself), because the upper-directory hardening
(mode + ACL, below) only runs when the broker can see and manage that
directory tree directly. A broker that has no local copy of the export —
for example a hypothetical future in-cluster GKE broker — is **not
supported** by `shared_dir_storage: nfs`: `resolveSharedDirs` refuses,
naming the missing path, rather than letting Kubernetes create the `subPath`
itself. (Kubelet would create a missing `subPath` as the export's squashed
anonymous identity on an `all_squash` export — exactly the identity the
upper-directory hardening exists to keep out — so silently tolerating a
missing host base there would quietly defeat it.) This applies to both
runtimes this tier wires up: the co-located Docker broker always has local
access by construction, and the `gke` runtime profile's pods only ever reach
the export via the PVC/`subPath` that same co-located broker's host base
resolves — there is no in-cluster broker process in this tier.

This page summarizes what an operator running or maintaining this tier needs
to know.

## Settings

```yaml
# ~/.scion/settings.yaml (global) on the broker
schema_version: "1"
server:
  shared_dir_storage:
    backend: nfs
    nfs:
      mount_root: /srv              # where THIS broker sees the share root
      shares:
        - id: scion-shared          # host base becomes <mount_root>/<id>
          server: <nfs-server-ip>   # informational; used verbatim in the PV manifest
          export: /srv/scion-shared
          pv_name: scion-shared     # k8s PVC claim name in the agent namespace
      subpath_root: projects        # default "projects"
runtimes:
  gke:
    type: kubernetes
    context: gke_<project>_<region>_<cluster>
    namespace: scion-agents
    gke: true
profiles:
  gke:
    runtime: gke
```

`server.shared_dir_storage` is Layer-0: global-only, never written to the DB,
and requires a broker restart to take effect. `uid`, `gid`, `mount_options`,
and `storage_class` on the `nfs` block are meaningful for
`server.workspace_storage` but are **not used** by `shared_dir_storage` — the
broker logs a one-time warning at startup if any of them are set, and logs the
resolved layout (`backend`, `host_base`, `subpath_root`, `pv_name`) exactly
once per start.

The hub's own shared-dir file browser (project pages in the web UI) uses this
same setting and the same confined resolver, so `scratchpad` listings work
whether the project is browsed via a co-located Docker broker or lives only on
GKE. When the setting is unset or `local`, both the broker and the hub file
browser behave exactly as they do today — this is an additive, opt-in feature.

## Security posture

NFS authentication is `sec=sys`: none. The server trusts the numeric uid the
client sends, but this doesn't matter in practice because every client is
squashed to a fixed identity (see below). Authorization is by source network
only, enforced at two layers: the export's client list and a VPC firewall
rule.

> **Network shape:** a static `spec.nfs` `PersistentVolume` is mounted by
> **kubelet on the node**, from the node's own network namespace — not by the
> pod. The NFS server therefore always sees the **node's primary IP**, never a
> pod IP, regardless of the cluster's egress-NAT policy. An export or firewall
> rule scoped to the pod CIDR fails outright with `access denied by server`.
>
> This means:
> - **Export client list:** the GKE **node subnet** (e.g. `10.128.0.0/20`), not
>   the pod CIDR.
> - **Firewall:** allow `tcp:2049` with `--source-tags <gke-node-network-tag>`
>   to a target tag (e.g. `scion-nfs`) at **priority 900**, plus an explicit
>   **DENY** for `tcp:2049` from `0.0.0.0/0` to that same target tag at
>   **priority 950**. The deny rule matters: without it, a network's broad
>   `default-allow-internal` rule (typically priority 65534) re-opens port 2049
>   to every VM in the VPC, silently widening the intended node-subnet-only
>   access.
> - **Net effect on the security posture:** *better* in one respect — pods can
>   no longer reach `nfsd` directly at all; only kubelet mounts, and only for a
>   pod spec that names the PV/PVC. *Weaker* in another — at the nfsd layer,
>   any host in the node subnet is trusted, not just the specific nodes running
>   scion agent pods. The firewall narrows this to nodes carrying the GKE node
>   network tag; on a network without a broad allow-internal rule, the deny
>   rule at 950 is harmless defense in depth.
> - For a future `deploy.sh` tier option (Phase 3), the node subnet comes from
>   the cluster's own subnetwork, and the node tag from the cluster's node
>   pool / Autopilot node tag.

Project isolation between agents is a **path convention** (each project's
`subPath` under one shared PVC), not a storage boundary: any pod spec in the
agent namespace that names the shared PVC can mount the **entire** export, not
just its own project's subtree. This holds only because agents do not author
pod specs or hold Kubernetes API credentials — the broker's kubeconfig lives on
the VM, never in a pod. **Treat the GKE cluster used for this tier as
trusted**: any workload with Kubernetes API rights to create a pod in the agent
namespace, or any operator with `kubectl` access to that namespace, can read or
write every project's shared directory on the export.

Traffic is cleartext inside the VPC. There is no encryption in transit beyond
GCP's VPC-level protections, and no Kerberos / NFS-over-TLS on the target
kernel/Ubuntu release.

**Export the root of a filesystem, not a subdirectory of a larger one.** This
tier's default export is a subdirectory on the boot disk, which is affected by
the gap below; the fix is to export the root of its own filesystem instead.
Exports use `no_subtree_check` (the nfs-utils default; `subtree_check` breaks
file handles when files are renamed across directories), which comes with a
specific cost: knfsd does not verify that a presented file handle's inode lies
inside the exported subtree; any valid handle on the same filesystem is
accepted. When the export path is a subdirectory of a larger filesystem, any
host the export admits (see Network shape above) can construct a file handle
for a different inode on that *same underlying filesystem* and reach it as
the squashed NFS identity, even though that inode sits outside the exported
subtree entirely. Exporting the root of its own dedicated filesystem removes
this gap by construction: there is nothing else on that filesystem for a
forged handle to reach (this assumes nothing else is bind- or sub-mounted
beneath the export with `crossmnt`/`nohide`; each such filesystem is exposed
the same way and needs to be its own root as well).

### E2 hardening: dedicated squash identity + default ACL

Phase 1 squashes every NFS client to the **broker's own uid** (`all_squash,
anonuid=<broker-uid>,anongid=<broker-gid>`). That has an accepted residual,
tracked as `ptone/scion#1794`: an NFS client that is indistinguishable, at the
filesystem layer, from the broker itself can write anywhere the broker can —
including planting a symlink above a project's own leaf directory, which could
redirect a later Docker bind mount (dockerd re-resolves the bind path at
container create, after the broker's own checks — this specific race is a
**separate, still-open residual**).

Phase 2 ships the **code** side of closing the upper-directory part of this:

- Every intermediate directory the broker creates (`<subpath_root>/`,
  `<pid>/`, `shared-dirs/`) is `2755` — setgid, but **not** group-writable.
- Each shared dir's own leaf directory stays `2775` (setgid, group-writable),
  **plus** a minimal default POSIX ACL (`u::rwx,g::rwx,o::r-x`, inherited by
  every new child) is set on it when the broker creates it. This closes a
  concrete finding from UAT: a file created by a *root*-owned process inside a
  Docker container (a common container-entrypoint pattern) comes out
  `0:<group> 0644` — group has read only, no write — so a GKE pod squashed to
  a *different* uid in the same group couldn't write it. The default ACL fixes
  this **for files created with a permissive requested mode** (the common
  case, e.g. a plain `0666`/`0777` create, which is what the umask mechanism
  assumes). It does **not** override a creator that explicitly requests a
  restrictive mode (an explicit `0644` stays `0644` — POSIX ACL inheritance
  only grants what the requested mode also allows).
  - The ACL is set with `Fsetxattr` on the export's local ext4 filesystem —
    that's what the broker's own process has open, since it's the one doing
    the write. `ENOTSUP`/`EOPNOTSUPP` (falls back to plain `2775`, no ACL,
    with one warning logged per process — not a startup failure) happens
    when the host base itself is a mount the broker reaches only as an NFS
    *client* (an NFSv4 client can't set `system.posix_acl_*` at all), or
    when the underlying filesystem otherwise lacks ACL support. This tier's
    own target — the broker writing its own export's ext4 directly, with
    knfsd applying inheritance to NFS clients server-side — always
    supports it; the ACL layer isn't a property of the NFS protocol version
    NFS clients happen to use.

**This code is not sufficient on its own, and `ptone/scion#1794` is not
closed by it.** The upper-directory hardening only actually blocks a
malicious NFS client when the export's `anonuid`/`anongid` is a **dedicated
identity distinct from the broker's own uid** — otherwise a squashed client is
still owner-equivalent on those directories regardless of their mode.
If the export squashes to the broker's own uid, this hardening is inert.
Closing the residual end to end requires:

1. provisioning a dedicated NFS squash uid, in the `scion` group but distinct
   from the broker's own uid, and pointing the export's `anonuid=`/`anongid=`
   at it — infrastructure work, not broker code, tracked for the Phase 3
   `deploy.sh` tier option (new deployments) and as a separate ops action for
   existing deployments;
2. verifying end to end in a scratch-project validation with that dedicated
   identity in place.

Until both are done, treat `ptone/scion#1794` as **open**.

**Existing directories created under Phase 1** (mode `2775`, no ACL, before
this hardening shipped) are not retroactively fixed by an automatic migration
— consistent with this feature's own "no automatic migration" precedent (see
Migration below). If you need to harden an existing tree by hand, the recipe
below fixes it in place.

**Use an fd-based, top-down approach, matching the broker's own `EnsureLeaf`
code.** The recipe below opens every component with `O_NOFOLLOW|O_DIRECTORY`
and `fchmod`s/`setxattr`s the resulting file descriptor, so hardening a
directory never depends on a path still pointing at the same place it did
when it was found -- there is no separate resolve-then-act step for a
concurrent change to land in.

**First, if any directory in the tree might be owned by the squashed NFS
identity rather than the broker uid** (possible wherever an upper directory
was still group-writable, which is exactly what this recipe is fixing): as
root, `chown` it to the broker uid first. A mode change alone does not help
against a mismatched *owner* — the broker's own writes to these directories
rely on being the owner, not just a group member.

Run the script itself as the **broker uid**, not root, against the resolved
host base and the configured `subpath_root` (default `projects`; the walk
handles a multi-component value like `tier/projects` too, refusing at
whichever component is a symlink):

```bash
sudo -u scion python3 fix_shared_dir_modes.py /srv/scion-shared projects
```

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""fd-based, top-down, symlink-safe fix-up for shared_dir_storage=nfs trees
created before Phase 2's leaf modes/ACL hardening shipped. Run as the broker uid (the
export's owner), never as root, and never against a directory that hasn't
first been chowned to the broker uid if it might be owned by the squashed
NFS identity (a mode change alone does not help against a mismatched owner).

Best-effort: a PermissionError fchmod'ing a directory, or any OSError
setxattr'ing a leaf (ENOTSUP/EOPNOTSUPP included, but not only those), is
reported to stderr and does not abort the rest of the walk -- siblings and
the remaining tree still get fixed. The process exit code reflects this: 0
if nothing was skipped, 3 if one or more directories were (see the summary
line printed either way), 1 if subpath_root itself couldn't be walked at
all, 2 for a usage error.

### Shared-dir removal

With `shared_dir_storage: nfs`, both project deletion and single-shared-dir
removal act on the export, not just the database:

- **Deleting a project** removes that project's entire
  `<subpath_root>/<project-id>/shared-dirs` tree from the export (and the
  now-empty `<project-id>` directory alongside it), via the same fd-based,
  symlink-safe walk used everywhere else in this tier.
- **Removing a shared directory from a project**
  (`DELETE /projects/{id}/shared-dirs/{name}`) also deletes that shared
  dir's directory and all of its contents from the export, via the same
  fd-based walk, leaving the project's other shared dirs and structural
  directories untouched.

Both are best-effort: a failure removing the export-side tree is logged, not
surfaced to the caller, and never blocks or rolls back the corresponding
database change.

## Boot-disk trade-offs

The NFS export (`/srv/scion-shared`) lives on the VM's **boot disk** rather
than a separate persistent disk. The default layout is a plain subdirectory of
`/`, which has a real gap (see the Export layout row and Security posture
above); keeping the export on the boot disk as a loop-mounted filesystem
instead avoids it. The trade-offs below are real either way and should inform
how you operate this tier:

| Concern | Consequence | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| **Fill risk** | The OS, container images/layers, agent workspaces, SQLite (`hub.db`), and the NFS export all share one filesystem. A runaway agent writing to the scratchpad, from either runtime, can fill `/` — which breaks SQLite writes, dockerd, and journald together, taking down the whole hub, not just the scratchpad. | Alert on `/` usage above 80%. Periodically check `du -sh /srv/scion-shared/projects/*` for outliers. There is no reserved-capacity protection for the export specifically. The dedicated-filesystem layout below gives the export its own size cap, independent of `/`. |
| **Snapshots** | A boot-disk snapshot captures the OS, the hub DB, and the scratchpad together. You cannot roll back the scratchpad independently, and restores are all-or-nothing. | Accept this for scratch data. To recover a single file, mount a snapshot-derived disk on another VM and copy it out. |
| **Lifecycle** | Tearing down the VM (and its boot disk) deletes all shared-dir data with it. Recreating the VM starts with an empty scratchpad. | Know this before tearing down a VM that has scratchpad data you care about. A dedicated persistent disk for the export is the upgrade path if this becomes unacceptable, but is not built in this phase. |
| **I/O contention** | NFS clients, container overlay I/O, and SQLite all compete for the same disk. A low-baseline-IOPS boot disk (e.g. `pd-standard`) makes this worse. | Acceptable for scratch data; prefer `pd-balanced` or better for the boot disk if this tier sees heavy shared-dir traffic. The boot disk can be grown online (grow the PD, then `growpart` + `resize2fs`). |
| **With the default (subdirectory) layout: no mount boundary** | There's no separate mountpoint to fail to mount (a small upside), but also no size isolation between the export and everything else on `/`. | The recommended dedicated-filesystem layout below adds a mount (and the size isolation that comes with it), at the cost of a mount that can fail — see its own fail-closed step. |
| **Export layout** | This tier's default export is a plain subdirectory of the boot disk's root filesystem, which accepts a forged file handle for any inode on that filesystem, not just the exported subtree (see Security posture above). | Export the root of a dedicated filesystem instead — a loop-file filesystem on the boot disk, or a separate disk. A subdirectory export is not recommended. |

**Creating the export as a dedicated filesystem root.** The recommended
approach: put the export on its own filesystem (a loop-mounted image file on
the boot disk here; a separate disk is the same recipe with the device in
place of the image file and no `loop` option) rather than a subdirectory of
`/`. Run once, as root:

```bash
# Create and format the backing image, but only the first time -- never
# re-create or re-format one that already exists, since that would
# destroy its contents on every re-run of any provisioning automation.
test ! -e /var/lib/scion-shared.img || { echo "image exists; not re-creating" >&2; exit 1; }
fallocate -l 100G /var/lib/scion-shared.img      # preallocated: also gives the size isolation from / noted above
mkfs.ext4 -q /var/lib/scion-shared.img           # ext4: the ACL support the E2 section below relies on
mkdir -p /srv/scion-shared

# Mount it before the NFS server starts, and fail closed if it never
# becomes a mountpoint: x-systemd.before= only orders the units, it does
# not create a dependency, so a mount failure alone would otherwise let
# nfs-server start anyway and export the bare directory on / -- exactly
# the gap this layout exists to close. x-systemd.required-by= is what
# turns "ordered before" into "required by", so nfs-server.service will
# not start if this mount unit fails.
echo '/var/lib/scion-shared.img /srv/scion-shared ext4 loop,x-systemd.before=nfs-server.service,x-systemd.required-by=nfs-server.service 0 2' >> /etc/fstab
systemctl daemon-reload
mount /srv/scion-shared
mountpoint -q /srv/scion-shared || { echo "mount failed; refusing to continue" >&2; exit 1; }
```

The export path is the mounted filesystem's own root, not a subdirectory
under it. The exports(5) `mp` (mountpoint) option is the export-side half of
the same fail-closed guarantee -- it makes knfsd itself refuse to serve the
path unless it's currently a mountpoint, which also covers a mount that fails
on a later reboot, not just at initial provisioning time:

```
/srv/scion-shared <node-subnet>(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,all_squash,anonuid=<uid>,anongid=<gid>,mp)
```

**Ownership and mode.** A freshly formatted filesystem's root is
`root:root 0755`, which is not what the broker needs: per the E2 hardening
below, the export root itself must be owned by the **broker's own uid**
(not the squash identity), group `scion`, mode `2755` -- setgid but not
group-writable, same as every other upper-level directory the broker
creates. Set this once, right after the first mount:

```bash
chown <broker-uid>:scion /srv/scion-shared
chmod 2755 /srv/scion-shared
```

**On an existing deployment.** Switching an already-running hub to this
layout replaces the filesystem underneath the export, which the Reboot/
stale-handle caveats below already flag as an ESTALE trigger -- treat it as a
migration, not a live change:

1. Stop the hub and any GKE agents so nothing is reading or writing the
   export during the copy.
2. Create and mount the new filesystem at a temporary path (the block
   above, with a scratch mountpoint instead of `/srv/scion-shared`).
3. Copy the existing tree across, preserving ACLs: `rsync -aAX
   /srv/scion-shared/ /mnt/new-export/`.
4. Apply the ownership/mode step above to the new filesystem's root.
5. Unmount the temporary mountpoint, then mount the same filesystem at
   `/srv/scion-shared` (update `/etc/fstab` accordingly) and
   `exportfs -ra`.
6. Restart the hub and GKE agents; existing NFS clients need to remount.
7. Once you've verified the copy, remove the old data from `/`.

## Reboot, stale-handle, and cross-runtime visibility caveats

- **Reboots block, they don't lose data.** During a VM reboot, GKE agents'
  I/O against their shared dirs **blocks** (the PV uses `hard` mounts) and
  resumes after the VM comes back up plus the NFSv4 grace period (~90s). The
  hub itself is down for the same window, so this isn't a new failure domain
  — but unattended kernel-upgrade reboots on the VM will trigger it. Schedule
  a maintenance window if you enable unattended upgrades.
- **`kubectl delete` can hang.** Deleting a pod while the NFS server is
  unreachable can leave it `Terminating` until the server returns.
- **ESTALE is rare, not a reboot symptom.** It only happens if the exported
  directory itself is deleted and recreated, or the filesystem's identity
  changes underneath the export — not on a plain reboot. If it happens,
  restart the affected pods.
- **Visibility is asymmetric across runtimes, by design (no loopback NFS on
  the Docker side).** Docker agents write directly to local
  disk and see their own writes immediately; other Docker agents on the same
  VM see them immediately too. GKE pods see VM-side writes after
  close-to-open revalidation or attribute-cache expiry — bounded to about 3
  seconds by this tier's `actimeo=3` mount option, rather than the NFS
  default's up-to-60-second staleness window.
- **`inotify`/file-watching is not a cross-runtime signal.** A watcher
  running inside a GKE pod never sees changes made by the Docker side (or by
  any other NFS client) — this is standard NFS client behavior, not specific
  to this tier. Do not build any cross-runtime coordination that assumes a
  file-system watch fires for a write made by the other runtime; poll, or use
  an explicit signal instead.
- **`all_squash` affects only NFS clients**, i.e. only the GKE side. It has
  no effect on the Docker broker's own uid, which is why the broker's own uid
  is what the export squashes *to*, not the other way round.

## Migration (enabling this on an existing deployment)

`shared_dir_storage` is opt-in and additive. When it's unset or `local`,
behavior is byte-identical to today — no existing single-node, HA, or
`workspace_storage: nfs` deployment is affected by this feature existing.

When you enable it on a deployment that already has projects with scratchpad
data:

- **Existing scratchpads stay in their legacy location.** New agents see an
  **empty** directory under the new NFS layout. There is no automatic
  migration — copying on first use would race with any agent that's already
  running, and can involve a lot of data.
- To migrate existing data by hand, **stop the hub first**, then for each
  project:

  ```bash
  rsync -a ~/.scion/project-configs/<slug>__<uuid>/shared-dirs/<name>/ \
           /srv/scion-shared/projects/<project-id>/shared-dirs/<name>/
  ```

  The project ID for a given slug is available from `scion project list
  --json` or the hub API (it's the same hub-assigned ID injected into every
  agent dispatch as `SCION_PROJECT_ID`, not the broker-local `<slug>__<uuid>`
  directory name).
- **Rollback is symmetric:** remove the `shared_dir_storage` block and
  restart. Agents go back to reading/writing the legacy local directories.
  Anything written under the NFS export while the setting was enabled stays
  there and can be copied back the same way.

## Known limits (tracked, pre-existing, out of scope for this tier's own code)

These were all found during hybrid-tier UAT but are pre-existing gaps, not
regressions introduced by this feature. They matter operationally for anyone
running this tier:

- **`ptone/scion#1799`** — a profile's `harness_overrides.<harness>.image`
  loses to the template/agent's own image default, so **pinning an image
  through a settings profile does nothing today**. If you need a specific,
  reproducible image for this tier (recommended, since GKE and Docker agents
  should run the same build to keep behavior comparable across runtimes), pin
  it via `--image <digest>` at agent start, or bake the pin into the template
  itself — not via a profile.
- **`ptone/scion#1800`** — registering or linking a project rewrites the
  entire global `settings.yaml` (key order changes, zero-value fields get
  serialized, and any key the settings struct doesn't know about is dropped).
  If you hand-maintain comments or extra keys in your global settings file,
  expect them to disappear the next time a project is registered.
- **`ptone/scion#1801`** — GKE agent pods run as the namespace's **default**
  Kubernetes service account, with its token automounted, because the k8s
  runtime doesn't set `automountServiceAccountToken: false` or require a
  dedicated service account. Exposure depends entirely on what RBAC exists in
  your agent namespace; review it for this tier's cluster specifically.
- **With `shared_dir_storage: nfs`, chat attachments aren't staged into
  NFS-backed shared dirs in this release.** Plan around this for projects on
  the NFS tier until a confined NFS attachment path is built.
- **This tier's default export is a plain subdirectory of the boot disk's
  root filesystem, not a dedicated filesystem's own root** (see Security
  posture and Boot-disk trade-offs above for what that costs, and how to
  export a dedicated filesystem root instead).

**Open question, not built:** the auxiliary Kubernetes runtime's behavior when
GKE credentials are broken or unreachable at hub startup (whether it degrades
gracefully to Docker-only, or blocks/delays hub startup) was flagged as an
open question in the design and was not independently verified during
Phase 1 UAT (the GKE dispatch path was exercised with working credentials
only). Until this is verified, assume broken GKE credentials on a hybrid-tier
broker could affect hub startup, and test credential rotation/expiry in a
non-production environment first.
