# Single-Node VM Deployment Guide

Deploy a Scion Hub on a Google Compute Engine (GCE) VM with Identity-Aware Proxy
(IAP) authentication. This tier uses released binaries, local storage, and a
Cloud Run IAP reverse proxy — no container builds, no GCS, no external database.

> Part of the Single-Node-VM deploy tier (ptone/scion#1575).

> **Adding a GKE target for shared-dir storage?** See the
> [Hybrid Deployment Tier](hybrid-tier.md) page — it extends this same VM with
> a second, Kubernetes-based place to run agents, sharing project scratchpads
> between the two runtimes over an NFS export served from this VM
> (`ptone/scion#1777`).

## Overview

The single-node-VM tier stands up a persistent GCE VM running the `scion` binary
from a GitHub Release. A Cloud Run service acts as an IAP-authenticated reverse
proxy, giving users browser access without exposing the VM directly. Agents
running on the VM connect to the Hub over localhost, bypassing IAP entirely.

Key properties:

- **Binary-based** — downloads a pre-built release; no source checkout or
  container build required.
- **Local storage** — Hub state lives in embedded SQLite on the VM disk; no GCS
  or Cloud SQL.
- **Local secrets** — secrets are stored on disk (`hub.env`); no Secret Manager.
- **IAP auth** — users authenticate via Google IAP through the Cloud Run proxy.
- **Idempotent** — re-running the deploy script converges without duplication.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| GCP project | A Google Cloud project with billing enabled |
| `gcloud` CLI | Authenticated (`gcloud auth login`) with a project set (`gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID`) |
| Required APIs | `compute`, `run`, `iap`, `cloudbuild`, `artifactregistry` — enabled automatically by the script |
| Permissions | Project Editor or equivalent (create VMs, Cloud Run services, service accounts, IAM bindings). The script also grants `roles/iap.tunnelResourceAccessor` to the deployer for SSH access to the private VM. |
| VM OS image | Ubuntu 22.04 LTS — pinned, not currently configurable (see [Architecture](#architecture)). |

## Quick Start

From the repository root:

```bash
./scripts/single-node-vm/deploy.sh
```

The script runs interactively, prompting for:

1. **Hub name** (default: `my-hub`) — used to derive resource names
2. **GCP region** (default: `us-central1`)
3. **Machine size** — Small (e2-standard-4) or Medium (n2-standard-16)
4. **Disk size** — 200 GB, 500 GB, or custom
5. **Chat plugins** — Telegram, Discord, Slack, Teams, or none
6. **Container images** — provide a registry path or build locally on the VM
7. **Admin email** — email address to grant super-admin access (defaults to deployer identity)
8. **Update policy** — Auto (install updates automatically), Notify (check and notify only), or Disabled

To install a specific release version:

```bash
./scripts/single-node-vm/deploy.sh --version v0.5.0
```

### Config File (Headless Mode)

To run the deployment without interactive prompts, create a JSON config file
that pre-answers all wizard questions and pass it with `--config`:

```bash
./scripts/single-node-vm/deploy.sh --config my-deploy-config.json
```

See `scripts/single-node-vm/deploy-config.example.json` for a documented
template with all available fields.

When a config file is provided:
- Fields present in the config are used directly (no prompt).
- Missing fields fall back to interactive prompts (if a terminal is
  attached) or sensible defaults.
- In fully non-interactive mode (no terminal on stdin), missing required
  fields cause the script to exit with an error rather than hanging on a
  `read`.

Example minimal config for headless deployment:

```json
{
  "hub_name": "my-hub",
  "region": "us-central1",
  "machine_size": "small",
  "disk_size_gb": 200,
  "container_images": {
    "source": "build"
  }
}
```

This is particularly useful for agent-driven deployments where a
conversational agent gathers answers from a user, writes the config file,
and runs `deploy.sh --config` headlessly.

- **User (browser)** — connects to the Cloud Run proxy URL; Google IAP
  authenticates the request before it reaches the proxy.
- **Cloud Run IAP Proxy** — a lightweight reverse proxy deployed from
  `extras/cloudrun-iap-proxy`. Forwards authenticated requests to the VM's
  internal IP on port 8080.
- **GCE VM** — runs the Scion Hub via a systemd unit (`scion-hub.service`)
  with the runtime broker co-located in the same process (`--enable-runtime-broker`).
  Has no public IP address. Sits on the default VPC so the Cloud Run proxy
  can reach it via internal networking. Docker is installed by cloud-init.
  The VM image is pinned to **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS** (`ubuntu-2204-lts` /
  `ubuntu-os-cloud` in `deploy.sh`); `cloud-init.yaml`'s Docker apt-repo setup
  is written specifically for this image. This is a deliberate design
  decision, not currently configurable — there is no demand for other
  distros, and making the image configurable would multiply an already-zero
  test matrix. Ubuntu 22.04 standard support ends April 2027; a bump to
  24.04 LTS should be its own tested change when the time comes.
- **Agents** — launched as Docker containers on the VM by the runtime broker;
  they connect to the Hub at `localhost:8080`, no IAP needed.

## What Gets Created

The deploy script creates the following GCP resources:

| Resource | Name pattern | Purpose |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| GCE VM | `scion-hub-<hub-name>` | Runs the Scion Hub binary via systemd |
| Service account | `scion-hub-<hub-name>@<project>.iam.gserviceaccount.com` | VM identity with logging/monitoring roles |
| Service account | `scion-hub-<hub-name>-proxy@<project>.iam.gserviceaccount.com` (truncated and hashed for long hub names) | Cloud Run proxy identity, with no project IAM roles |
| Cloud Run service | `scion-hub-<hub-name>-iap-proxy` | IAP-authenticated reverse proxy to the VM |
| IAM bindings | IAP `httpsResourceAccessor` for the deployer; `roles/run.invoker` for the IAP service agent on the Cloud Run proxy | Grants the deployer browser access through IAP; lets IAP itself invoke the proxy service |

On the VM itself:

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `/usr/local/bin/scion` | The Scion Hub binary |
| `/home/scion/.scion/settings.yaml` | Hub configuration (auth mode, storage, etc.) |
| `/home/scion/.scion/hub.env` | Environment variables (session secret, project ID) |
| `/home/scion/.scion/workspace-storage/` | Local workspace storage directory |
| `/home/scion/.scion/plugins/broker/` | Chat plugin binaries (if selected) |
| `/etc/systemd/system/scion-hub.service` | systemd unit file |

## Configuration

### settings.yaml

The Hub configuration file. The deploy script writes it in two stages:

1. **During VM setup (Phase 3)** — `auth.mode: dev` for initial health checks
   via SSH tunnel.
2. **After IAP is ready (Phase 5)** — `auth.mode: proxy` with the IAP audience
   string, enabling IAP-based authentication.

Final configuration:

```yaml
schema_version: "1"
image_registry: "localhost/scion"
server:
  hub:
    name: "my-hub"
    admin_emails:
      - "you@example.com"
  maintenance:
    deployment_tier: "binary"
    release_channel: "stable"
    update_policy: "auto"
  storage:
    local_path: /home/scion/.scion/workspace-storage
  secrets:
    backend: local
  auth:
    mode: proxy
    proxy:
      provider: iap
      iap:
        audience: "/projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/REGION/services/SERVICE"
  listen_port: 8080
```

Key settings:

- `schema_version` — must be `"1"` (not `settings_version`).
- `image_registry` — required, even for locally built images. Set to
  `localhost/scion` for local builds, or the registry path for remote images.
- `admin_emails` — email(s) auto-promoted to super-admin on login.
- `storage.local_path` — all workspace data stored on the VM's local disk.
- `secrets.backend: local` — secrets are read from `hub.env` on disk, not from
  GCP Secret Manager.
- `auth.mode: proxy` — the Hub trusts the IAP proxy header for user identity.
- `auth.proxy.iap.audience` — the IAP audience string, computed automatically
  from the project number, region, and proxy service name.
- `maintenance.deployment_tier` — `"binary"` for release-based deployments
  (set automatically by the deploy script). Source deployments use `"source"`.
- `maintenance.release_channel` — which release channel to track for updates:
  `"stable"` or `"preview"`. Default: `"stable"`.
- `maintenance.update_policy` — controls automatic update behavior:
  - `"auto"` — check for updates on a schedule and install automatically
    (recommended for binary deployments).
  - `"notify"` — check for updates and show a banner in the admin UI; admin
    must manually trigger the update.
  - `"disabled"` — no automatic update checking (manual checks via the admin
    UI still work).

### hub.env

Environment variables for the Hub process, stored at
`/home/scion/.scion/hub.env`:

```bash
SESSION_SECRET=<randomly-generated-base64>
SCION_GCP_PROJECT_ID=<your-project-id>
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=<your-project-id>
```

The `SESSION_SECRET` is generated once during initial deployment and preserved
on subsequent runs.

### Hub-scoped agent env vars

`hub.env` configures the Hub process only. The env vars that agents receive
are stored in the hub database. After the Phase 3 health check, the deploy
script writes these hub-scoped env vars (injection mode `always`) into
`/home/scion/.scion/hub.db` with `sqlite3`:

| Key | Value |
|-----|-------|
| `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` | your project ID |
| `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION` | `global` (the global Vertex AI endpoint, intentionally) |

They appear in the admin UI as hub env vars, and you can edit them there.
The deploy only seeds these keys when they are absent. Edits made in the
admin UI are kept across redeploys, and a deleted key is created again on the
next deploy. If the write fails, the deploy continues and prints the command to
run manually.

## Chat Plugins

During deployment, the script prompts you to select chat integrations:

| Option | Plugin | Binary installed |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Telegram | `scion-plugin-telegram` |
| 2 | Discord | `scion-plugin-discord` |
| 3 | Slack | `scion-plugin-slack` |
| 4 | Teams | `scion-plugin-teams` |
| 5 | None | (no plugins) |

You can select multiple plugins by entering comma-separated numbers (e.g.,
`1,2` for Telegram and Discord).

Plugins are downloaded from the same GitHub Release as the main binary and
installed to `/home/scion/.scion/plugins/broker/`. Each plugin runs as a
broker plugin within the Hub process.

## Container Images

Agents need container images to run (core-base, scion-base, and harness images
like scion-antigravity). The deploy wizard offers two options:

### Option 1: Provide a registry path

If you have already pushed images to a container registry (e.g., Artifact
Registry), select this option and provide the registry path. The Hub will
pull images from the registry at runtime.

Example registry path: `us-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/scion`

### Option 2: Build images locally on the VM

This option clones the Scion source repository onto the VM and builds the
minimal set of images needed for deployment: core-base, scion-base, and
scion-antigravity (the default harness).

The build runs in the background on the VM (via `nohup`) so it survives
SSH disconnects. The deploy script polls for completion and shows progress.

**Requirements:**
- Approximately 30-45 minutes of build time
- Approximately 30 GB of additional disk space
- The VM must have outbound internet access (provided by Cloud NAT)

Images are tagged under the `localhost/scion` prefix (e.g.,
`localhost/scion/scion-antigravity:latest`) and `image_registry` is set to
`localhost/scion` in the Hub configuration. The runtime broker resolves
images through this registry prefix.

## Access Patterns

### Web access (browser via IAP)

Open the Cloud Run proxy URL printed at the end of deployment:

```
https://scion-hub-my-hub-iap-proxy-HASH-REGION.a.run.app
```

You will be prompted to authenticate with your Google account. IAP enforces
access — only users with the `roles/iap.httpsResourceAccessor` binding on the
proxy service can reach the Hub.

To grant additional users access:

```bash
gcloud iap web add-iam-policy-binding \
  --resource-type=cloud-run \
  --service=scion-hub-my-hub-iap-proxy \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --project=PROJECT_ID \
  --member=user:colleague@example.com \
  --role=roles/iap.httpsResourceAccessor
```

### Agent access (localhost on the VM)

Agents running on the VM connect directly to `localhost:8080`. No IAP
authentication is needed — the agents are co-located with the Hub.

### CLI access (via IAP)

To use the `scion` CLI from your local machine against the deployed Hub,
configure it to authenticate through IAP using the Cloud Run proxy URL.

### SSH access (via gcloud)

Since the VM has no public IP, use `gcloud compute ssh` to connect:

```bash
gcloud compute ssh scion-hub-my-hub \
  --zone=us-central1-b \
  --project=PROJECT_ID
```

To view Hub logs:

```bash
gcloud compute ssh scion-hub-my-hub \
  --zone=us-central1-b \
  --project=PROJECT_ID \
  --command='sudo journalctl -u scion-hub.service -f'
```

## Teardown

To delete all resources created by a previous deployment:

```bash
./scripts/single-node-vm/deploy.sh --delete
```

The teardown flow prompts for the hub name and region, then deletes:

1. The Cloud Run IAP proxy service
2. The GCE VM instance
3. The service account

**Note:** IAP access bindings are scoped to the region, not to the service.
Teardown does not remove them. To clean up IAP bindings manually:

```bash
gcloud iap web get-iam-policy \
  --project=PROJECT_ID \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --resource-type=cloud-run
```

## Troubleshooting

### Health check fails after deployment

The Hub takes a few seconds to start. If the health check does not pass within
60 seconds, check the service logs:

```bash
gcloud compute ssh scion-hub-my-hub \
  --zone=us-central1-b \
  --project=PROJECT_ID \
  --command='sudo journalctl -u scion-hub.service --no-pager -n 50'
```

Common causes:
- Cloud-init did not finish (Docker or scion user not yet created)
- Port conflict on 8080
- Invalid `hub.env` or `settings.yaml`

### Cannot reach the Cloud Run proxy URL

- **403 Forbidden** — you do not have the IAP access binding. Run the
  `gcloud iap web add-iam-policy-binding` command above.
- **IAP not yet enforcing** — IAP takes 30-60 seconds to activate after being
  enabled. The deploy script waits 60 seconds, but in rare cases it may take
  longer.
- **VPC connectivity** — the Cloud Run proxy must be on the same VPC as the VM.
  The script deploys with `--network=default --subnet=default --vpc-egress=all-traffic`.

### Cloud-init takes too long

Cloud-init installs Docker and creates the `scion` user. The script waits up to
5 minutes. If it times out, the VM may still be provisioning. SSH into the VM
and check:

```bash
gcloud compute ssh scion-hub-my-hub \
  --zone=us-central1-b \
  --project=PROJECT_ID \
  --command='tail -20 /var/log/cloud-init-output.log'
```

### Hub starts but IAP authentication does not work

After the IAP proxy is deployed, the script updates `settings.yaml` from
`auth.mode: dev` to `auth.mode: proxy` and restarts the Hub. If authentication
is not working:

1. Verify the settings on the VM:
   ```bash
   gcloud compute ssh scion-hub-my-hub \
     --zone=us-central1-b \
     --project=PROJECT_ID \
     --command='cat /home/scion/.scion/settings.yaml'
   ```
2. Confirm `auth.mode` is `proxy` and the `audience` string matches the
   project number and service name.
3. Check that the Hub restarted successfully after the settings update.

### Re-running the deploy script

The script is idempotent. Re-running it will:
- Skip creating the VM and service account if they already exist
- Preserve the existing `hub.env` (and its `SESSION_SECRET`)
- Seed the hub-scoped `GOOGLE_CLOUD_*` env vars only if they are absent (admin edits are preserved)
- Overwrite `settings.yaml` with the current configuration
- Re-deploy the Cloud Run proxy (converges to the same state)
