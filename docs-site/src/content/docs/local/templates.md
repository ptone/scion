title: Templates & Roles
description: Define reusable, harness-agnostic agent roles with Scion templates, compose them with skills, and manage them locally or through a Hub.
---

A **template** defines an agent's *role* — its purpose, instructions, and persona — as a small directory of files you can version, share, and reuse. Templates are **harness-agnostic**: the same `code-reviewer` role can run on Claude, Gemini, or any other supported harness. The harness-specific mechanics (container image, concrete model, auth) live separately in a **harness-config**, so a template stays portable across backends.

Templates work hand-in-hand with **skills** — reusable instruction snippets a template can bundle or pull from the [Skill Bank](/scion/local/skills/). A role is the "who"; skills are the "how-to" capabilities you graft onto it.

:::note
Looking for a real-world set of roles? The [scion-frontiers/agent-team](https://github.com/scion-frontiers/agent-team) repository is a ready-to-use library of templates (`coordinator`, `developer`, `architect`, `code-reviewer`, `doc-writer`, …) and shared skills. It is referenced throughout this page as a practical example.
:::

## What a template is

A template is a directory. Its **name is the directory name** — there is no `name` field to keep in sync. A typical template looks like this:

```text
code-reviewer/
├── scion-agent.yaml     # role configuration (the only file Scion parses)
├── agents.md            # operational instructions for the agent
├── system-prompt.md     # the core persona / role definition
├── home/                # optional: portable dotfiles copied into the agent's home
│   └── .config/
│       └── my-tool.conf
└── skills/              # optional: template-mounted skills (see Skills, below)
    └── review-checklist/
        └── SKILL.md
```

Only `scion-agent.yaml` is required for Scion to recognize the directory as a template. Everything else is referenced *from* that file.

### `scion-agent.yaml`

The config file drives the role. Fields that point at content — `agent_instructions`, `system_prompt` — accept **either a filename** (resolved relative to the template directory) **or inline text**. The convention is to keep prose in separate `.md` files:

```yaml
schema_version: "1"
description: "Senior code reviewer — correctness, readability, security, performance"

agent_instructions: agents.md      # file reference (or inline text)
system_prompt: system-prompt.md

default_harness_config: antigravity     # harness-config to use when none is given

env:
  REVIEW_STRICTNESS: high

model: large                       # portable size alias — see Model size aliases

skills:
  - uri: "gh://scion-frontiers/agent-team/pr-code-review"

resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "500m"
    memory: "512Mi"
```

Common fields:

| Field | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `schema_version` | Schema marker; use `"1"`. |
| `description` | Human-readable summary of the role. |
| `agent_instructions` | Path to (or inline) operational instructions, mounted as the harness's agent instructions file. |
| `system_prompt` | Path to (or inline) the system prompt / persona. |
| `default_harness_config` | The harness-config to use when the user does not pass one. |
| `model` | Model **size alias** (`small`, `medium`, `large`, `extra-large`) — see [Model size aliases](#model-size-aliases). |
| `skills` | Skill references to resolve at provision time — see [Skills](#skills). |
| `env` | Environment variables for the agent. |
| `resources` | CPU/memory requests and limits. |
| `mcp_servers` | MCP server definitions, translated per harness. |
| `secrets` | Secrets the agent requires. |
| `volumes`, `services`, `max_turns`, `max_duration`, `telemetry`, `kubernetes` | Further runtime knobs. |

:::tip
Top-level keys accept **either hyphens or underscores** — `default-harness-config` and `default_harness_config` are equivalent. Underscored form is canonical.
:::

:::caution
Keep harness-specific settings **out** of the template. `image`, `auth_selectedType`, and concrete `model` names (e.g. `opus`, `gemini-pro`) are still accepted for backward compatibility but emit a deprecation warning — they belong in a [harness-config](#harness-configs) so the template stays portable. The legacy `harness` field is rejected outright; use `default_harness_config` or the `--harness-config` flag instead.
:::

## Creating an agent from a template

You reference a template by name (or by path/URI) with the `--type` / `-t` flag:

```bash
# Provision and launch an agent from the code-reviewer template
scion start my-review my task... --type code-reviewer

# Explicitly choose the harness-config as well
scion start my-review --type code-reviewer --harness-config gemini

# Provision without starting (writes the agent dir + prompt.md for later)
scion create my-review my task... --type code-reviewer
```

`--type` also accepts an **absolute path** or a **remote URI**, so you can run a template straight from a repository without importing it first:

```bash
# Run a role directly from GitHub (deep path into the agent-team repo)
scion start coord --type gh://scion-frontiers/agent-team/templates/coordinator

# Run from a locally cloned checkout
scion start coord --type ./templates/coordinator
```

### Which harness-config is used

When you do not pass `--harness-config`, Scion resolves it in this order:

1. **CLI flag** — `--harness-config` (alias `--harness`).
2. **Template default** — `default_harness_config` in the template's `scion-agent.yaml`.
3. **System default** — `default_harness_config` in the global `settings.yaml`.

## Template composition & inheritance

Every non-`default` template automatically **inherits the `default` template as a base layer**. When an agent is provisioned, Scion builds a chain — `default` first, then your template — and layers them:

- **Config** is merged field-by-field (`MergeScionConfig`): your template's values override the base, maps like `env` and `mcp_servers` are unioned, and `skills` are **appended** (so base skills are kept and yours are added).
- **Content references** (`agents.md`, `system-prompt.md`) are resolved by walking the chain from most-specific to least-specific, so a file inherited from the base is still found even if your template doesn't redefine it.
- **`home/` files** from the base are copied first, then overlaid by your template's `home/`.

This is why a minimal template only needs a `scion-agent.yaml` plus the files it wants to override — common dotfiles and defaults come from `default` for free.

### Mandatory Instruction Preamble Injection

To ensure consistent and reliable agent execution across the platform, Scion enforces a **mandatory instruction preamble injection** mechanism during the provisioning pipeline:

- **What it is:** Scion automatically loads all Markdown files from an embedded boilerplate filesystem (`mandatory_boilerplate/`) and **prepends** them directly to the final `agent_instructions` file inside the agent's home directory.
- **Why it exists:** This guarantees that every provisioned agent — regardless of template, role, or harness choice — is seeded with critical platform contracts before starting.
- **Embedded contents:**
  - **Workspace Orientation:** Clear explanations of `SCION_WORKSPACE_MODE` (`shared-plain`, `worktree-per-agent`, `clone-per-agent`), `SCION_WORKSPACE_GIT`, and how directories/shared volumes are mounted.
  - **Agent Status Signals:** Exact protocols directing the agent to explicitly declare its execution states via `sciontool status` (e.g. `sciontool status ask_user "<question>"`, `sciontool status blocked "<reason>"`, or `sciontool status task_completed "<task>"`). This prevents false stall timeouts, handles notifications routing, and tracks progress.
- **Template Isolation:** Because this preamble is injected programmatically by the Hub or CLI, it cannot be overridden, removed, or bypassed by custom templates, securing baseline platform behaviors across all agents.

The final composition layers on top of the chosen harness-config:

1. **Harness-config base layer** — runtime mechanics (image, model aliases, auth, base tool files).
2. **Template overlay** — the role (config, prompts, instructions, skills).
3. **Runtime overrides** — CLI flags and per-agent tweaks.

## Skills

Templates and skills are complementary: a template gives an agent its role, and skills give it reusable, harness-agnostic capabilities that are mounted into the harness's skills directory at provision time. There are **two ways** a template delivers skills.

### 1. Template-mounted skills

Commit skill folders directly inside the template's `skills/` directory. They travel with the template and need no Hub:

```text
web-builder/
├── scion-agent.yaml
├── agents.md
└── skills/
    ├── gcs-static-site/
    │   └── SKILL.md
    └── gcs-auth-proxy/
        ├── SKILL.md
        └── scripts/
            └── main.go
```

When the template chain is provisioned, Scion collects the skills from each template and mounts them into the harness-specific location:

| Harness | Skills directory |
| :--- | :--- |
| Claude | `.claude/skills/` |
| Gemini | `.gemini/skills/` |

When multiple templates are chained, skills from later templates overlay earlier ones.

### 2. Skill Bank references

Instead of bundling files, declare skills by **URI** in the `skills:` list. These are resolved at provision time from the [Skill Bank](/scion/local/skills/) (a Hub-backed registry) or a federated source such as GitHub:

```yaml
# templates/coordinator/scion-agent.yaml
schema_version: "1"
description: "Project coordinator — delegates implementation, drives progress"
agent_instructions: agents.md
system_prompt: system-prompt.md

skills:
  - uri: "gh://scion-frontiers/agent-team/agent-recovery"
  - uri: deploy-checklist                       # bare name → latest, default search order
  - uri: "skill://scion/global/notes@^1.2"      # semver range
  - uri: "gh://my-org/skills/linting"           # federated GitHub source
    as: lint-rules                              # mount under a different name
  - uri: "skill://scion/user/alice/scratch"
    optional: true                              # don't fail provisioning if unresolved
```

Each entry supports `uri` (required), `as` (mount under a different name), and `optional` (continue provisioning if it can't be resolved). For the full URI grammar, scopes, versioning, and the `scion skills` publishing workflow, see [Skills — Authoring & Publishing](/scion/local/skills/) and [Skill Registry & Federation](/scion/hosted/single-node/skill-registry/).

:::tip
A skill supplied by a template always takes precedence over a **platform skill** (one embedded in the Scion binary and injected automatically) of the same name.

### The `team-creation` skill

Scion ships a built-in **`team-creation`** skill for generating coordinated multi-agent template sets. It scaffolds orchestrator-worker patterns with best-practice guidance for agent-to-agent communication and template structure — a fast way to bootstrap a whole team of roles rather than hand-writing each template.

## Built-in vs custom templates

- **`default`** — the built-in template shipped inside the Scion binary. It seeds common `home/` dotfiles and the baseline `agents.md` status-signaling instructions, and it is the base layer every other template inherits. It is **protected** — it cannot be deleted. Use `scion templates update-default` to refresh it from the binary (`--force` to overwrite an existing copy).
- **Custom templates** — anything you create, clone, or import. They live in one of two scopes.

### Template locations & resolution order

| Scope | Location |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Project** | `.scion/templates/<name>/` (in the current project) |
| **Global** | `~/.scion/templates/<name>/` (your machine) |

When you reference a template by bare name, Scion searches in this order and uses the first match:

1. **Remote URI** (GitHub URL / deep path, archive, or rclone) — fetched and cached.
2. **Absolute path** to a template directory.
3. **Project** templates (`.scion/templates/`).
4. **Global** templates (`~/.scion/templates/`).

When connected to a Hub, templates can also resolve from the Hub across three scopes: **User** (personal templates), **Project** (project-level templates), and **Global** (hub-wide templates). If a name matches in several locations, the CLI prompts you to choose; the `--local`, `--hub`, and `--global` flags narrow the search.

In the Web Dashboard's **New Agent** creation form, templates are automatically clustered and ordered by scope in the dropdown:
```text
User Templates  >  Project Templates  >  Global Templates
```
Visual separators clearly segment these categories, ensuring your personal, customized templates are always at the top of the dropdown for fast access.

## The `scion templates` CLI

The command group is `scion templates` (singular `scion template` is an accepted alias).

### Local management

```bash
# List available templates (local, and Hub when connected), grouped by scope
scion templates list

# Show a template's resolved configuration
scion templates show code-reviewer

# Create a new template (seeded from the default template)
scion templates create my-new-role

# Create in global scope instead of the project
scion --global templates create my-new-role

# Clone an existing template (local or Hub source) to a new local one
scion templates clone code-reviewer my-custom-reviewer

# Delete a template (alias: rm)
scion templates delete my-old-role

# Refresh the built-in default template from the binary
scion templates update-default --force
```

### Importing existing agents

`scion templates import` converts agent definitions into Scion templates and writes them into your project (or global) templates directory. It understands Claude Code sub-agents (`.claude/agents/*.md`), Gemini CLI agents (`.gemini/agents/*.md`), and existing Scion templates (copied directly, no conversion):

```bash
# Import a single Claude sub-agent
scion templates import .claude/agents/code-reviewer.md

# Auto-discover and import everything under a project root
scion templates import --all .

# Import Scion templates from another repo (deep GitHub path)
scion templates import --all https://github.com/scion-frontiers/agent-team/tree/main/templates

# Preview without writing
scion templates import --dry-run .claude/agents/code-reviewer.md
```

Useful flags: `--all` (import every discovered agent), `--harness`/`-H` (force `claude`/`gemini` detection), `--name` (rename a single import), `--force` (overwrite), `--dry-run` (preview).

### Hub commands

When a Hub is enabled, these commands move templates between the local filesystem and the Hub:

```bash
# Upload a local template to the Hub (creates or updates; only changed files upload)
scion templates sync code-reviewer          # alias: scion templates push

# Sync every local project template at once
scion templates sync --all

# Sync to global scope, or under a different Hub name
scion --global templates sync code-reviewer
scion templates sync code-reviewer --name team-reviewer

# Download a Hub template to the local filesystem
scion templates pull code-reviewer --to .scion/templates/code-reviewer

# Compare local vs Hub (synced / out of date / local-only / hub-only)
scion templates status
```

`sync` is content-aware: it hashes files and uploads only what changed, and templates carry a content hash for traceability (visible in `scion templates list`, `scion templates show`, and the Web UI). 

Beyond the CLI, project templates are a **fully managed Hub-level resource** with full CRUD, SDK, and Web UI support. A connected Hub can import a whole repository of templates server-side via the **Load Templates** action in the Web UI, and imported templates can be browsed, edited, and deleted directly within the dashboard.

For the condensed command list, see the [CLI reference](/scion/reference/cli/#template-management).

## Harness-configs

A **harness-config** is the counterpart to a template: it holds the runtime *mechanics* a template deliberately omits, so roles stay harness-agnostic. Harness-configs live in `~/.scion/harness-configs/` (global) or `.scion/harness-configs/` (project) and contain:

- `config.yaml` — runtime parameters (container image, model aliases, auth type).
- `home/` — base files copied into the agent's home directory (e.g. `.claude.json`, `.gemini/settings.json`).

### Model size aliases

Templates should express model choice with abstract **size aliases** — `small`, `medium`, `large`, `extra-large` (`xl`) — rather than provider model names. Each harness-config maps those aliases to real models:

```yaml
# ~/.scion/harness-configs/claude/config.yaml
harness: claude
image: scion-claude:latest
model_aliases:
  small: haiku
  medium: sonnet
  large: opus
```

```yaml
# ~/.scion/harness-configs/gemini-cli/config.yaml
harness: gemini-cli
image: scion-gemini-cli:latest
model_aliases:
  small: gemini-flash-lite
  medium: gemini-flash
  large: gemini-pro
```

A template that sets `model: large` then resolves to `opus` under Claude and `gemini-pro` under Gemini — the same role, portable across harnesses. Concrete model names still pass through unchanged (for backward compatibility) but tie the template to one harness.

:::note
Model aliases are resolved by the Hub before they are stored in the agent's `AppliedConfig` and injected as the `SCION_MODEL` environment variable. This ensures harness provision scripts receive the fully resolved concrete model name (such as `gemini-pro`) rather than an unresolved alias.
:::

### Customizing and creating variants

Edit the files in a harness-config directory to change defaults (for example, remap `large` to a newer model, or add a persistent CLI flag in `home/.gemini/settings.json`). Copy the directory to make a variant:

```bash
cp -r ~/.scion/harness-configs/gemini ~/.scion/harness-configs/gemini-experimental
scion start test-agent --type default --harness-config gemini-experimental
```

If you break a stock harness-config, restore the factory defaults:

```bash
scion harness-config reset gemini
```

## Sharing templates

A template is just a directory, so sharing is straightforward:

- **Version it in a repo.** Commit templates under `.scion/templates/` (or a dedicated repo like [scion-frontiers/agent-team](https://github.com/scion-frontiers/agent-team)) and reference them by `gh://` URI or import them with `scion templates import`.
- **Publish to a Hub.** `scion templates sync` uploads a template so teammates on the same Hub can create agents from it by name.
- **Bundle capabilities as skills.** Pull shared behavior out into skills — either template-mounted or published to the [Skill Bank](/scion/local/skills/) — so multiple roles can reuse them.
