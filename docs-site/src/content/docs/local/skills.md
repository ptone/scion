title: Skills — Authoring & Publishing
description: Author, version, and publish reusable agent skills through the Scion Skill Bank.
---

A **skill** is a reusable, harness-agnostic instruction snippet — a folder containing a `SKILL.md` file plus any supporting files — that is mounted into an agent's harness at provisioning time. Skills follow the open [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/home) convention.

Scion supports two ways to deliver skills to agents:

- **Template-mounted skills** — skill folders committed inside a template's `skills/` directory. These travel with the template and require no Hub. See [Templates & Roles](/scion/local/templates/#skills).
- **The Skill Bank** — a Hub-backed registry that lets you publish versioned skills once and reference them by URI from any template or agent, with semantic-version resolution, content-hash caching, and federation across external registries.

This page covers the Skill Bank: how to author, publish, version, and consume skills with the `scion skills` command group. For Hub-side registry administration and federation, see [Skill Registry & Federation](/scion/hosted/single-node/skill-registry/).

:::note
The `scion skills` commands (except `create`) talk to a Hub. Make sure a Hub endpoint is configured — see [Connecting to a Hub](/scion/hosted/user/hosted-user/).

## Anatomy of a skill

A skill is a directory whose only required member is a `SKILL.md` file. `SKILL.md` has YAML frontmatter followed by Markdown instructions:

```text
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md          # required: frontmatter + instructions
├── reference.md      # optional: supporting docs
└── scripts/
    └── helper.sh     # optional: any supporting files
```

**`SKILL.md` example:**

```markdown
---
name: deploy-checklist
description: Pre-deployment checklist and rollback steps for production services.
---

# Deploy Checklist

1. Confirm the change has an approved PR.
2. Run the smoke-test suite.
3. ...
```

Frontmatter fields:

| Field | Required | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `name` | Yes | Skill name in **kebab-case** (lowercase alphanumeric with hyphens, 1–64 chars, no leading/trailing hyphen). |
| `description` | Yes | A short, human-readable summary shown in listings. |

### Scaffolding a new skill

`scion skills create` scaffolds a local skill directory with a starter `SKILL.md`. It is a purely local operation — nothing is published.

```bash
scion skills create deploy-checklist
# Created skill directory: deploy-checklist/
#   deploy-checklist/SKILL.md  (edit this file)
```

Edit the generated `SKILL.md`, add any supporting files, then [publish](#publishing-a-skill) when ready.

## Referencing skills from an agent

Skills are consumed by declaring them in the `skills:` list of a `scion-agent.yaml` (in a template or an agent config). Each entry references a skill by URI and is resolved at provision time:

```yaml
# scion-agent.yaml
schema_version: "1"
name: release-manager

skills:
  - uri: deploy-checklist              # bare name → latest, default search order
  - uri: skill://scion/global/notes@^1.2   # semver range
  - uri: gh://my-org/skills/linting        # federated GitHub source
    as: lint-rules                          # mount under a different name
  - uri: skill://scion/user/alice/scratch
    optional: true                          # do not fail provisioning if unresolved
```

| Field | Required | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `uri` | Yes | A [skill reference URI](#skill-reference-uris) or bare skill name. |
| `as` | No | Mount the skill under a different directory name. |
| `optional` | No | If `true`, provisioning continues even when the skill cannot be resolved. |

At provisioning time Scion resolves every required skill, downloads its files (using the [content-hash cache](#content-hash-caching)), and mounts them into the harness's skills directory (for example `.claude/skills/` or `.gemini/skills/`).

## Skill reference URIs

A skill reference is either a **bare name** or a full `skill://` URI. Federated sources use their own schemes (`gh://`, `gcp-skill://`).

**Grammar:**

```text
skill://<registry>/<scope>/<scopeId>/<name>@<version>
```

Most segments are optional. Common forms:

| Form | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| `deploy-checklist` | Bare name — default registry (`scion`), scope search order, `latest`. |
| `skill://scion/global/deploy-checklist` | Explicit registry + `global` scope. |
| `skill://scion/project/<projectId>/deploy-checklist` | Project-scoped skill (scope + scope ID). |
| `skill://scion/user/<userId>/scratch@1.4.0` | User-scoped skill, exact version. |
| `skill://project/deploy-checklist` | Scope-alias form (registry defaults to `scion`). |
| `skill://registry.example.com/global/tool@^2.0` | External registry (federation). |
| `gh://<owner>/<repo>/<path>@<ref>` | Skill sourced from a GitHub repository. |
| `gcp-skill://<alias>/<skillId>@<version>` | Skill sourced from GCP Vertex AI. |

### Version specifiers

The `@version` suffix accepts:

- `latest` (the default when omitted) — the highest published, non-deprecated stable version.
- An exact version, e.g. `1.4.0` (a leading `v` is stripped).
- A semver range, e.g. `^1.0`, `~1.2`, `>=1.0.0` — resolves to the highest matching version.
- A content hash, e.g. `sha256:abc123…` — resolves to the exact bytes with that hash.

### Scopes and resolution order

Skills live in one of four **scopes**:

| Scope | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `core` | Built-in platform skills. |
| `global` | Shared across all users of the Hub. |
| `project` | Scoped to a specific project (requires a scope ID). |
| `user` | Personal to a specific user (requires a scope ID). |

When a reference does not name a scope, the Hub searches in this order and returns the first match:

```text
user → project → global → core
```

More specific scopes therefore override broader ones — a user's own skill shadows a global skill of the same name.

## Publishing a skill

`scion skills publish` uploads a local skill directory to the Hub as an immutable, versioned release. A `--version` (valid [SemVer 2.0.0](https://semver.org/)) is required, and the directory must contain a `SKILL.md`.

```bash
# Publish version 1.0.0 (creates the skill if it does not yet exist)
scion skills publish ./deploy-checklist --version 1.0.0

# Publish into a specific scope for a new skill (default is global)
scion skills publish ./deploy-checklist --version 1.0.0 --scope project

# Publish a new version of an existing skill by ID
scion skills publish ./deploy-checklist --version 1.1.0 --skill-id <skill-id>
```

**Flags:**

| Flag | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `--version` | *(required)* | SemVer version to publish (e.g. `1.0.0`). |
| `--scope` | `global` | Scope for a **newly created** skill: `core`, `global`, `project`, or `user`. |
| `--skill-id` | *(auto)* | Publish a new version for an existing skill ID. If omitted, Scion matches by directory name and creates the skill when no match exists. |

**Per-version limits:** at most **50 files**, **10 MB** per file, and **50 MB** total. `.git/`, `.DS_Store`, `__pycache__`, and files matching `.gitignore` patterns are excluded automatically.

On success the command reports the resolved version and its `sha256:` content hash:

```text
Published deploy-checklist v1.0.0 (hash: sha256:9f2b…)
```

## Versioning and immutability

Each publish creates a new `SkillVersion`. Versions are content-addressed by a `sha256:` hash computed over their files, so a given `name@version` always resolves to the same bytes. This makes resolution reproducible and enables the [content-hash cache](#content-hash-caching).

To retire a version without deleting it, deprecate it. Deprecated versions remain resolvable by exact reference but are skipped by `latest` and range resolution.

```bash
scion skills deprecate deploy-checklist \
  --version 1.0.0 \
  --message "Superseded by 2.x" \
  --replacement "skill://scion/global/deploy-checklist@^2.0"
```

| Flag | Required | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `--version` | Yes | The version to deprecate. |
| `--message` | Yes | Message shown to users of the deprecated version. |
| `--replacement` | No | Skill URI users should migrate to. |

## Content-hash caching

Runtime brokers cache resolved skill content on disk, keyed by its `sha256:` content hash, under:

```text
~/.scion/cache/skills/
```

Because the cache is content-addressed, identical content is stored once regardless of how many skills or versions reference it, and a cached entry is reused across agents and re-provisions without re-downloading. The cache is size-bounded (100 MB by default) with least-recently-used eviction.

## Managing skills

```bash
# List skills (optionally filter by scope, search text, or tags)
scion skills list
scion skills list --scope global --search deploy
scion skills list --tags ci,production          # comma-separated, AND semantics

# Show a skill's details and its versions
scion skills show deploy-checklist

# List all versions of a skill
scion skills versions deploy-checklist

# Resolve a URI to a concrete version, hash, and file manifest
scion skills resolve "skill://scion/global/deploy-checklist@^1.0"

# Soft-delete a skill (archived, retained for history)
scion skills delete deploy-checklist        # alias: rm
```

Most commands accept either a skill **name** or **ID**. Add the global `--format json` flag for machine-readable output.

:::tip
`scion skill` (singular) is an alias for `scion skills`.

## Batch-Adding Injected Skills via the Web UI

In addition to managing templates manually, the Scion Web Dashboard allows configuring **Injected Skills** for a project, user profile, or globally on the Hub. To simplify adding multiple skills at once, Scion provides a **directory-discovery** workflow:

1. Under the settings page (Project Settings, User Profile, or Hub Settings), open the **Injected Skills** panel and click **Add Skill**.
2. Paste a GitHub directory URL (e.g., `https://github.com/org/repo/tree/main/skills-directory`) into the **Skill URI** input.
3. If the input matches a directory structure on GitHub, a **Discover Skills from Directory** helper button appears.
4. Clicking it triggers an automated scan of the remote directory. A **checkbox interstitial dialog** will display all discovered skill subdirectories.
5. Select or deselect skills using the checkboxes, then click confirm. 
6. Scion adds all checked skills as individual URI references in a single atomic update.

:::note[Security & Privacy]
Before performing discovery or logging requests, Scion's API automatically strips any embedded userinfo or credentials from the URL, preventing sensitive tokens or usernames from appearing in system logs.
:::

## Platform skills

Beyond skills you publish, **platform skills** are injected automatically at provisioning — a set of skills embedded in the Scion binary and injected into every agent. They provide baseline capabilities without any Hub or template setup.

Platform skills honor an optional `inject_when` frontmatter condition in `SKILL.md`, which gates injection on the agent's environment:

| `inject_when` | Injected when |
| :--- | :--- |
| *(unset)* | Always. |
| `git_workspace` | The workspace is a git repository. |
| `hub_enabled` | The agent is connected to a Hub. |

A skill supplied by a template always takes precedence over a platform skill of the same name.
