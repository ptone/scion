title: Agent Lifecycle — Suspend, Resume & Recovery
description: Pause and resume agents with their harness session intact, recover crashed agents, and understand auto-suspend of stalled agents.
---

Beyond the basic `start` / `stop` pair, Scion gives you finer control over an
agent's lifecycle: you can **suspend** an agent and later **resume** it with its
harness conversation intact, recover an agent that **crashed**, and rely on the
Hub to **auto-suspend** agents that have stalled in order to reclaim resources.

This page is for power users driving agents from the CLI. For the conceptual
model behind phases and activities, see [Core Concepts: Agent State Model](/scion/concepts/#agent-state-model).

## Stop vs. Suspend: two ways to wind down

Both `stop` and `suspend` tear down the agent's container, but they record very
different intent:

| | `scion stop` | `scion suspend` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase after** | `stopped` | `suspended` |
| **Next `start`** | Fresh harness session | **Continues** the previous conversation |
| **Use when** | The task is done, or you want a clean slate | You'll come back and want the agent to pick up where it left off |
| **Harness requirement** | None | Harness must support session resume |

:::note
Suspend/resume relies on the agent's home directory persisting across the
container being torn down. On the Docker runtime, the agent home is a host
bind-mount, so this works with no extra configuration. Runtimes with an
ephemeral home (Kubernetes, Cloud Run) need durable home persistence (e.g. a
network filesystem); see [Runtime caveats](#runtime-caveats) below.
:::

## Suspend & Resume

### Suspending an agent

```bash
scion suspend <agent-name>
```

This stops the agent's container but marks its phase as `suspended` — a signal
that you intend to resume it later. Only a **running** agent can be suspended.

To suspend every running agent in the current project at once:

```bash
scion suspend --all
```

Suspend requires a harness that supports session resume. If the agent's harness
does not (for example, the `generic` harness), the command is rejected with an
error and you should use `scion stop` instead. When using `--all`, unsupported
agents are skipped rather than failing the whole batch.

### Resuming an agent

```bash
scion resume <agent-name> [task]
```

`resume` re-launches the container and continues the prior harness conversation
by passing the harness-specific resume flag (`--continue` for Claude Code,
`--resume` for Gemini CLI, and so on). Any `[task]` arguments you supply are
appended to the resumed session as a new prompt, if the harness supports it.

| Flag | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `-a, --attach` | Attach to the agent's session immediately after resuming. |

### `start` and `resume` are intent-aware

You do not have to remember which command to use — Scion looks at the agent's
saved phase and does the right thing:

- **`scion start` on a *suspended* agent** performs an **implicit resume**: the
  harness session is continued, exactly as if you had run `scion resume`.
- **`scion resume` on a *stopped* agent** starts a **fresh** session — there is
  no prior conversation to continue, so it falls back to a clean start.

In other words, the *agent's phase* decides whether the session is continued or
started fresh; the command name is just a hint.

### Harness support

Session resume is a per-harness capability:

| Harness | Resume support |
| :--- | :--- |
| Claude Code | ✅ Yes (`--continue`) |
| Gemini CLI | ✅ Yes (`--resume`) |
| Generic | ❌ No — use `stop`/`start` |

## Crash Recovery: the `error` phase

When an agent's process or container exits **non-zero** — a real crash, an
out-of-memory kill, or a `SIGKILL` — the agent transitions to the `error` phase
with a descriptive message such as `Agent crashed with exit code 137`.

Scion is careful to distinguish a crash from an orderly shutdown. The harness
runs inside `tmux`, and `sciontool` recovers the real exit code when the session
ends, then classifies it:

| Outcome | Phase | Activity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Clean exit (code 0) | `stopped` | — |
| Limits reached (turns, model calls, or duration) | `stopped` | `limits_exceeded` |
| Crash / OOM / `SIGKILL` (non-zero) | `error` | — (cleared) |

A crash surfaces as the **`error` phase** — the activity is cleared, and the
crash detail is carried in the agent's message (e.g. `Agent crashed with exit
code 137`). Two paths can set `error`: `sciontool` reports it from the recovered
exit code (the authoritative path), and the Hub also derives `error` from a
non-zero container exit reported in the broker heartbeat — which covers cases
where the container died before `sciontool` could report.

:::note
A normal `scion stop` sends `SIGTERM`, which harnesses like Claude Code handle
gracefully and exit cleanly (code 0). Only a *genuine* crash or a hard kill
produces the `error` phase — stopping an agent never leaves it in `error`.
:::

The `error` phase is **restartable**. Starting the agent again clears the error
and runs a **fresh** session:

```bash
scion start <agent-name>
```

Because the crash discarded the previous run, this is a clean start rather than
a session continuation.

## Auto-Suspend of Stalled Agents

To reclaim resources from agents that are no longer making progress, the Hub can
automatically suspend agents that have **stalled**.

An agent is marked `stalled` by the platform when its heartbeat is still being
received (the process is alive) but no activity events have arrived within the
stall threshold (default: **5 minutes**). After it remains stalled for an
additional grace period (a further **5 minutes**, so roughly **10 minutes** of
inactivity in total), the Hub auto-suspends it — provided that:

- the agent's harness supports session resume, and
- the container is still alive.

Auto-suspend uses the same machinery as a manual `scion suspend`, so the agent's
phase becomes `suspended` and its harness session is preserved. The agent is
**resumed automatically on the next message** sent to it, continuing right where
it left off.

:::tip
If your agent is *intentionally* idle — for example, waiting on a child agent or
a scheduled event — have it declare itself `blocked` (via
`sciontool status blocked "<reason>"`). Blocked agents are excluded from stalled
detection and therefore from auto-suspend.
:::

:::caution
The stall threshold and grace period are currently hardwired and not
user-configurable. Auto-suspend is a Hub-driven behavior and depends on the
Hub's scheduler being operational.

## Troubleshooting & Diagnostics

Most stuck, stalled, or failing agents are recoverable without deleting and recreating them. Recreating an agent should be a last resort, as it destroys unpushed working tree files and terminal history. 

Always start by running `scion look <agent-name>` to inspect the active screen state and `scion logs <agent-name>` to review internal telemetry before performing recovery.

### 1. Common Stuck States & Recovery (Triage Table)

| Symptom | Probable Cause | Correct Recovery Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Transient API errors** in logs | LLM provider rate-limits, quotas, or minor timeouts. | Send a wake-up command: `scion message <agent-name> "continue"`. Do *not* recreate the agent. |
| **`LIMITS_EXCEEDED`** state | The agent reached its configured turn, model call, or duration ceiling. | Send a continue command: `scion message <agent-name> "continue"`. This clears the ceiling for another cycle. |
| **Cryptographic primitive error** | The Hub regenerated its signing keys (e.g., on restart) or there is a key mismatch in a multi-replica deployment. | Send `scion message <agent-name> "continue"`. Message delivery does not rely on the agent's own token. If looping, contact the operator: the Hub's `SharedSigningSecret` (`SESSION_SECRET`) must be pinned in the deploy config. |
| **Deadlocked token refresh** (401 loops in logs) | The agent's token expired and its automatic refresh loop deadlocked. | Try sending `scion message <agent-name> "continue"`. If this has no effect, recreate the agent. |
| **Phase `created` / lastSeen zero** for 5+ minutes | The agent creation timed out or failed to schedule. | The system is likely under heavy resource pressure. Wait a few minutes. If still stuck, delete and recreate. **To prevent:** reduce concurrent agent starts. |
| **Start fails with `no_runtime_broker` (422)** | Temporary connection issue after a system restart or project reconnect. | Wait 30–60 seconds and try starting again. If persistent, verify broker status with `scion broker status`. |
| **Split-Brain Configuration** (git project ignore settings) | Config files are loading incorrectly due to overlapping global vs. project settings. | Run `scion config dir` to see the effective config path. Ensure the merge chain matches: `defaults → global → in-repo → external → environment`. |
| **Interactive prompt blocking** | The agent's harness is stuck waiting for an unhandled prompt (e.g. yes/no query). | Send the dismissive keystroke raw to the terminal: `scion message <agent-name> --raw "ENTER"` (or `"y"`, etc.). |

## Deletion Authority & Hierarchical Teardown

`scion delete <agent-name> --non-interactive` immediately reclaims container resources. Since an agent's true deliverable is its **artifact** (pushed commits, opened PRs, files written to a shared volume), **deleting a completed agent is the default, recommended clean-up path.**

However, to prevent premature deletion of agents with active or pending tasks, strict teardown guidelines must be followed.

### 1. Who May Authorize Deletion

| Agent Role | Authorized to Delete | Allowed Timing |
|---|---|---|
| **Worker** (Developer, Reviewer) | The agent's creator or supervisor. | Immediately once the output has been accepted and verified. |
| **Investigator / Architect** | The agent's creator or supervisor. | **Only after all questions to humans are answered** and the investigation is explicitly concluded. |
| **Project Initiator** (The very first agent in a project) | **Explicit human instruction only.** | Initiators carry project continuity from inception through closure and must survive worker cycles. |
| **Project Lead / Coordinator** | **Explicit human instruction naming the workstream.** | Only when a human operator commands to close down that specific workstream. |

### 2. Hierarchical (Bottom-Up) Teardown

When cleaning up a complex multi-agent hierarchy, teardown must proceed **bottom-up** to avoid leaving orphaned containers running:

1. The parent orchestrator learns its goal is reached and notifies the child sub-agents.
2. The child sub-agents finish their current cycle, push their work, and signal completion.
3. The parent orchestrator deletes the child worker agents.
4. The parent orchestrator confirms its entire subtree is deleted and exits.
5. The human operator or higher-level parent deletes the parent orchestrator.

### 3. Safety Rules for Cleanup

1. **Completion is not Deletion**: A completed task means the work is finished, not that the agent should be deleted. The user or coordinator may want to assign a follow-up task.
2. **Unanswered Questions block Deletion**: If an agent has raised an open, unanswered question to a user, it **cannot** be deleted.
3. **Commit is not Push**: Never delete an agent with unpushed work. Always verify that all local commits have been pushed to the remote branch, and any local deliverables have been copied to shared directories or volumes.

## Runtime caveats

Session continuation works only when the agent's **home directory** — where the
harness stores its conversation state — survives the container being reclaimed.
Treat suspend/resume and auto-suspend *session continuation* as a Docker-proven
capability, with this caveat for other runtimes:

- **Docker** — the proven path. The agent home is a host bind-mount that
  survives the container being reclaimed, so suspend/resume and auto-suspend
  continue the harness session with no additional configuration. The same holds
  for any setup with a persistent or NFS-backed home.
- **Kubernetes / Cloud Run** — these runtimes can have an ephemeral home. Without
  durable home persistence, resume restarts the container but the harness session
  **may not continue**. Durable home persistence (for example, object storage
  such as GCS) is future work, and these runtimes are gated on NFS-style
  persistence regardless — so do not assume full suspend/resume parity here yet.
