title: Workspaces & Sharing Modes
description: The workspace sharing modes — Shared-plain, Worktree-per-agent, Clone-per-agent and Empty-per-agent — that decide how a project's agents share (or isolate) their working directory.
---

Every Scion **agent** runs against a **workspace** — the working directory mounted into its container at `/workspace`, where it reads code, makes changes, and runs commands. When a project runs several agents at once, a key question follows: do they share one directory, or does each get its own?

Scion answers this with a project-level setting called the **workspace sharing mode**. There are three modes for git and shared workspaces, used by both local and Hub-managed projects, plus **Empty-per-agent** for Hub-managed projects without git. This page explains each mode and when to use it. The definitions follow the canonical [`GLOSSARY.md`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/scion/blob/main/GLOSSARY.md).

:::note[Not "two strategies"]
Earlier documentation framed workspaces as "two strategies" (worktrees vs. a git-init clone). That framing is superseded. The current model is the sharing modes described below: **Shared-plain**, **Worktree-per-agent**, **Clone-per-agent** and **Empty-per-agent**.
:::

## The sharing modes

### Shared-plain

One workspace directory is mounted into **every agent, with no per-agent isolation**. All agents in the project see and modify the same files at the same time.

This is the default for **plain (non-git) projects**, where there is no git history to branch from. It suits data directories, document sets, and other non-source content that a group of agents collaborate on directly.

- **Isolation:** none — agents share one directory.
- **Requires git:** no.
- **Best for:** plain projects; tasks where agents are meant to work on a common, shared set of files.

### Worktree-per-agent

Each agent gets its own [git worktree](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) over a **shared checkout**, isolating working trees while sharing one clone's history.

Every agent operates on the same repository history but has an independent working directory (typically created under `../.scion_worktrees/<project>/<agent>` on a dedicated branch) mounted as `/workspace`. Agents cannot step on each other's uncommitted changes, and their work is merged back to the main branch manually (for example, `git merge <agent-branch>`).

- **Isolation:** per-agent working tree; shared history.
- **Requires git:** yes.
- **Availability:** supported in **local mode** and on **Hub-managed git projects** created with workspace mode `worktree-per-agent` (requires git 2.48 or later on the broker). On Kubernetes it requires NFS workspace storage.
- **Best for:** local git projects where multiple agents work in parallel on the same repository.

### Clone-per-agent

Each agent gets its **own full git clone** of the repository — the strongest isolation of the three.

When a Hub manages a git-based project, agents are provisioned with an independent clone via a robust `git init` + `git fetch` strategy rather than a shared worktree. The broker injects `SCION_GIT_CLONE_URL`, `SCION_GIT_BRANCH`, and a `GITHUB_TOKEN`; `sciontool init` then initializes the workspace, fetches the repo over HTTPS, and checks out a `scion/<agent-name>` branch. This strategy is consistent across all broker machines, whether or not the repo already exists locally, and cleanly handles workspaces that already contain `.scion` metadata.

- **Isolation:** full — each agent has its own clone.
- **Requires git:** yes (and a `GITHUB_TOKEN`; host SSH credentials are not used).
- **Best for:** Hub-managed git projects, and any case where agents need completely independent checkouts across machines.

### Empty-per-agent

Each agent in a **Hub-managed project without git** gets its **own private directory** that starts empty.

The directory is not a git repository, and no other agent can see it. It lives under the agent's directory on the Runtime Broker (`<project>/agents/<agent>/workspace`). On Kubernetes with NFS workspace storage it lives on the NFS export instead, at `<subpath_root>/<project-id>/agents/<agent>/workspace`.

- It is kept across suspend/resume where storage allows, including on Kubernetes with NFS workspace storage. On Kubernetes without NFS workspace storage (including `gke-shared-volume`), the contents are lost when the agent stops (see [Kubernetes](/scion/hosted/ha/kubernetes/)).
- It is deleted together with the agent. Use [shared directories](#2-the-shared-directories-invariant) for files that agents should share or that must outlive an agent.
- Files from your local project directory are **not** uploaded into it. When you start an agent from a local non-git directory, the CLI shows the Hub's warning that the files were ignored.
- Reincarnate (moving the agent to another Runtime Broker) is not supported for this mode.
- Runtime Brokers whose default runtime is Cloud Run or Substrate do not support this mode (the `cloudrun-sandbox` runtime does). Once such a broker has sent its first heartbeat it reports that it lacks the `emptyPerAgentWorkspace` capability, and creating such an agent there fails with `412 Precondition Failed`. Before that first heartbeat, the Hub may still dispatch the agent, and the Cloud Run or Substrate runtime then rejects it with an error. The capability reflects only the broker's default runtime: an agent that uses a Cloud Run or Substrate runtime profile on a broker whose default runtime is neither gets no `412`, and fails with an error when it starts.

Summary:

- **Isolation:** full — each agent has its own directory.
- **Requires git:** no (Hub-managed projects without a git remote only).
- **Best for:** independent tasks that each produce their own files, such as research or scratch work, where agents must not see each other's output.

## Choosing a sharing mode

| | Shared-plain | Worktree-per-agent | Clone-per-agent | Empty-per-agent |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Isolation** | None (shared dir) | Per-agent working tree | Full per-agent clone | Full per-agent directory |
| **Git required** | No | Yes | Yes | No (no git only) |
| **Starts with** | The shared files | A checkout of the branch | A checkout of the branch | An empty directory |
| **Shares history** | n/a | Yes (one clone) | No (independent clones) | n/a |
| **Typical setting** | Plain projects | Local git projects | Hub-managed git projects | Hub-managed projects without git |

A useful rule of thumb:

- **No git, collaborate on shared files** → **Shared-plain**.
- **No git, each agent works on its own** → **Empty-per-agent**.
- **Local git repo, parallel agents, one shared history** → **Worktree-per-agent**.
- **Hub-managed git project, or agents that need fully independent checkouts** → **Clone-per-agent**.

Note that the same git project used locally with worktrees may switch to clone-based provisioning once it is managed by a Hub, unless the Hub project is created with workspace mode `worktree-per-agent`.

## Setting the mode on a Hub project

For Hub projects, the mode is set **when the project is created** and cannot be changed afterwards. The API and CLI use three values; what `per-agent` means depends on whether the project has a git remote:

| Workspace mode value | Project with git remote | Project without git remote |
|---|---|---|
| *(not set)* | Clone-based provisioning (the existing default) | Shared-plain |
| `shared` | Shared-plain | Shared-plain |
| `per-agent` | Clone-per-agent | Empty-per-agent |
| `worktree-per-agent` | Worktree-per-agent | Rejected (`400`): requires a git remote |

```bash
# Hub-managed project where each agent starts in an empty private directory
scion hub projects create --name scratch --workspace-mode per-agent

# Git project with one worktree per agent
scion hub projects create https://github.com/acme/widgets.git --workspace-mode worktree-per-agent
```

The Hub rejects unknown values with `400`. The mode is stored in the server-owned `scion.dev/workspace-mode` label: you cannot set or change that label directly, on create or later with an update. Creating or starting an Empty-per-agent agent on a Runtime Broker that does not support this mode fails with `412 Precondition Failed` (`unsupported_capability`). The error names the Runtime Broker and says which ones work: Docker, Podman, Apple, and Kubernetes Runtime Brokers. Upgrade an older Runtime Broker, or pick one of those; upgrading does not help a Cloud Run or Substrate Runtime Broker. See [`scion hub projects create`](/scion/reference/cli/#scion-hub) and the [Projects API](/scion/reference/api/#projects-apiv1projects).

## Runtime environment variables

Agents can discover their workspace provisioning at startup through two environment variables. The Runtime Broker sets them when it starts an agent (Hub-dispatched agents, including Workstation mode). Agents started in local mode without a Runtime Broker do not get them.

### `SCION_WORKSPACE_MODE`

The canonical workspace sharing mode for the project. The Runtime Broker sets it on every agent it starts. When the project has no workspace mode, its value is `shared-plain`. That includes Hub git projects created without `--workspace-mode`, even though each of their agents gets its own clone; for those, `SCION_WORKSPACE_GIT=true` tells the agent the workspace is a git checkout.

| Value | Description |
|---|---|
| `shared-plain` | One workspace directory shared by all agents (no per-agent isolation). |
| `clone-per-agent` | Each agent has its own full git clone. |
| `worktree-per-agent` | Each agent has its own git worktree over a shared checkout. |
| `empty-per-agent` | Each agent has its own private directory that started empty (no git). |

**Example:** An agent in a Hub-managed git project created with workspace mode `per-agent` reads `SCION_WORKSPACE_MODE=clone-per-agent` to know it has a private checkout and can safely commit without affecting other agents.

### `SCION_WORKSPACE_GIT`

Present (value `"true"`) when the workspace is a git repository. Absent when the workspace is not git-backed, which is always the case for `empty-per-agent`.

`SCION_WORKSPACE_GIT` is separate from `SCION_WORKSPACE_MODE` because `shared-plain` can be either git-backed or a plain directory — the mode alone cannot disambiguate. Absent means false; there is no `"false"` string value.

**Compatibility note:** Older broker versions emitted only `SCION_SHARED_WORKSPACE=true` for shared-plain git workspaces. The `sciontool init` compat shim prefers the new vars and falls back to `SCION_SHARED_WORKSPACE` when they are absent. `SCION_SHARED_WORKSPACE` is deprecated and tracked for removal in [ptone/scion#575](https://github.com/ptone/scion/issues/575).

## Workspace Orientation & Invariants (Mandatory Boilerplate)

All Scion agents should run a **workspace orientation check** immediately upon startup. By reading `SCION_WORKSPACE_MODE` and `SCION_WORKSPACE_GIT`, an agent can adapt its behavior to match its level of isolation.

### 1. Per-Mode Behavior Guidelines

Depending on the effective workspace sharing mode, agents must adhere to the following rules:

* **When `SCION_WORKSPACE_MODE` is `shared-plain`**:
  * **Concurrency Hazard**: You are sharing a single filesystem directory with other agents in real-time. Edits you make are immediately visible to others, and others may modify files while you are working.
  * **Non-Assumption**: Do *not* assume a file remains unchanged between the time you read it and the time you write it.
  * **Coordination**: Before making broad, structural, or disruptive filesystem changes (such as renaming directories or refactoring shared libraries), use `scion message` to coordinate with other agents or the project coordinator.
* **When `SCION_WORKSPACE_MODE` is `worktree-per-agent`**:
  * **Private Working Tree**: Your working tree `/workspace` is private and isolated. You can edit files freely without stepping on other agents' uncommitted changes.
  * **Shared Git Repo**: The underlying git repository history, local branches, and refs are shared. Treat local branch names as a shared namespace to avoid collisions.
* **When `SCION_WORKSPACE_MODE` is `clone-per-agent`**:
  * **Full Isolation**: Your clone is entirely your own. Nothing you do to the working tree, local refs, or local branches will affect any other agent's workspace.
* **When `SCION_WORKSPACE_MODE` is `empty-per-agent`**:
  * **Private, Initially Empty**: `/workspace` is your own directory. It started empty and is not a git repository.
  * **Lifetime**: It is kept across suspend/resume where storage allows, and deleted with the agent. Put anything that other agents need, or that must outlive you, in a shared directory.

### 2. The Shared-Directories Invariant

Scion allows mounting persistent **Shared Directories** (such as a shared cache or scratchpad) into agent containers.

:::danger[Shared Directories are Always Shared]
**Shared directories are shared across all agents in every workspace mode — including the highly isolated `worktree-per-agent`, `clone-per-agent` and `empty-per-agent` modes.** They bypass working tree isolation. Treat shared directory paths as concurrent-access, zero-isolation storage.

## Git Operations & Safety for Agents

When operating within a git-backed workspace (`SCION_WORKSPACE_GIT=true`), agents must follow strict safety procedures to avoid data loss and build breaks.

### 1. Working Tree Reset Safety (`-fd` vs `-fdx`)

If you need to clean or reset a working tree to get a clean slate, **always default to `git clean -fd`, never `git clean -fdx`**.

* **`git clean -fd` (Safe)**: Removes untracked files but **respects `.gitignore`**. Crucial agent-local state files, `.scion/` directory metadata, and local cached credentials survive the clean.
* **`git clean -fdx` (Dangerous)**: Deliberately ignores `.gitignore` and **deletes everything untracked**. This will wipe your `.scion/` metadata, agent state, and configurations, causing immediate container and agent dysfunction.

### 2. Rebase-After-Deletion Guidance

When a pull request or merge deletes a file, performing a `git rebase` introduces a hidden logical hazard:

* **Standard Conflicts**: If someone concurrently edits the deleted file, git will raise a `modify/delete` conflict and halt the rebase, which is easily detected.
* **Dangling References**: If a concurrent change in a *different* file adds a new reference or call to the deleted file, git sees these as disjoint changes. The rebase will complete with **no conflicts** and report a successful merge, leaving a dangling reference that breaks the build or runtime execution.

**Required Procedure**: After performing any rebase or pull that deletes a file, you must run a repository-wide `grep` search for the deleted file's name/imports to verify that no new dangling references were introduced in other files.

## Related workspace concepts

A few adjacent terms are worth distinguishing from the sharing mode itself:

- **Shared directory** — a persistent, mutable volume shared by the agents within one project, separate from each agent's `/workspace`.
- **Agent home** — the directory mounted as the container user's home folder, holding that agent's unique config and history.

Both are independent of which sharing mode a project uses.
