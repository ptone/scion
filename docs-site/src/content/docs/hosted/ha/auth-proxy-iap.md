title: Proxy Auth (Google IAP)
description: Deploying the Scion Hub behind Google IAP with transport auth for agents.
---

This guide covers deploying a Scion Hub behind **Google Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP)**, using IAP for human authentication and hub-minted OIDC tokens for agent transport auth.

## Authentication modes

The Hub supports three **mutually exclusive** human authentication modes, selected by `auth.mode`:

| Mode | Use case |
|------|----------|
| `oauth` (default) | Hub runs its own OAuth flows (Google / GitHub). |
| `proxy` | Hub sits behind a trusted authenticating proxy (Google IAP, Cloudflare Access, etc.). |
| `dev` | Single-user local development with auto-generated dev tokens. |

Only one mode is active at a time. When `auth.mode` is `proxy`, the OAuth login UI, `/auth/providers`, and device-flow handlers are disabled. Human identity is derived entirely from the proxy's verified assertion.

Choose **proxy / IAP** when the Hub is already fronted by IAP (e.g., on Cloud Run with IAP enabled, or behind a GCE/GKE IAP-protected backend service) and you want to eliminate a separate OAuth integration.

Two verified proxy providers are available, selected by `auth.proxy.provider`:

- **`iap`** — Google IAP. Covered by most of this guide.
- **`jwt`** — any authenticating proxy that forwards a signed JWT. See [Generic JWT proxy provider](#generic-jwt-proxy-provider).

## Inbound: human IAP authentication

### How it works

1. A user's browser request passes through IAP, which authenticates the user and injects a **signed JWT** in the `X-Goog-IAP-JWT-Assertion` header.
2. The Hub verifies the JWT signature (ES256, via Google's JWKS endpoint), validates `iss`, `aud`, and `exp` claims, then extracts the user's email from the verified assertion.
3. On first verified request, the Hub **provisions** the user — applying the same access controls as the OAuth path (`user_access_mode`, `authorized_domains`, `admin_emails`). If the user is not permitted, the request is rejected with 403.
4. Suspended users are rejected regardless of IAP status.

The unsigned convenience headers `X-Goog-Authenticated-User-Email` and `X-Goog-Authenticated-User-Id` are **ignored** — only the cryptographically signed assertion is trusted.

### Middleware precedence

The proxy authenticator runs **after** higher-priority app-layer credentials:

1. Agent token (`X-Scion-Agent-Token` / agent JWT)
2. Broker HMAC (`X-Scion-Broker-ID`)
3. Bearer token (dev token / UAT / user JWT)
4. **Proxy authenticator** (IAP assertion) — runs only when no app-layer credential matched

This means agents and brokers traversing IAP are identified by their own credentials, not by the IAP service-account assertion.

### Configuration

In `settings.yaml` (under the `server` key):

```yaml
server:
  auth:
    mode: proxy
    proxy:
      provider: iap
      iap:
        # MANDATORY — the IAP audience for your backend.
        # Cloud Run format:
        #   /projects/<PROJECT_NUMBER>/locations/<REGION>/services/<SERVICE_NAME>
        # GCE/GKE backend service (GCLB) format:
        #   /projects/<PROJECT_NUMBER>/global/backendServices/<BACKEND_SERVICE_ID>
        audience: "/projects/123456789/global/backendServices/987654321"

        # Optional overrides (defaults are correct for production IAP):
        # issuer: "https://cloud.google.com/iap"
        # jwks_url: "https://www.gstatic.com/iap/verify/public_key-jwk"

      # Optional defense-in-depth: also verify source IP is a trusted proxy.
      # Uses the existing trusted_proxies CIDR list.
      require_trusted_proxy_ip: false

    # Access controls — same as for OAuth mode:
    user_access_mode: domain_restricted  # open | domain_restricted | invite_only
    authorized_domains:
      - example.com
    # admin_emails is set at the hub level:
  hub:
    admin_emails:
      - admin@example.com
```

#### IAP audience format

The `audience` value must match the audience claim (`aud`) in the IAP-signed JWT. The format depends on the backend type:

- **Cloud Run**: `/projects/<PROJECT_NUMBER>/locations/<REGION>/services/<SERVICE_NAME>`
- **GCE/GKE backend service (GCLB)**: `/projects/<PROJECT_NUMBER>/global/backendServices/<BACKEND_SERVICE_ID>`

You can find this value in the Google Cloud Console under **Security → Identity-Aware Proxy** → select your backend → **Signed Header JWT Audience**.

:::note[Preflight Validation & Normalization]
During startup in Hosted HA mode, Scion performs strict preflight checks to validate and normalize the `audience` configuration:
1. **Normalization**: Any leading/trailing whitespaces or trailing slashes are trimmed, and the normalized audience is written back to the configuration in-place. This prevents runtime signature verification failures caused by minor formatting differences.
2. **Format Enforcement**: The audience path must follow either the Cloud Run format or the GCLB/GKE backend service format. Other formats are rejected (fail-closed) with a detailed startup error.
3. **Endpoint Derivation Warning**:
   - For **Cloud Run** audiences, Scion can automatically derive the Hub's public URL format from the audience.
   - For **GCLB/GKE** backend-service audiences, Scion *cannot* automatically derive the public endpoint URL because a backend service ID does not contain regional or routing information. You **must explicitly configure the public URL** using the `SCION_SERVER_BASE_URL` environment variable (or `server.hub.public_url` / `SCION_SERVER_HUB_ENDPOINT`). If missing, Scion will log a warning at startup and fall back to `localhost`, which is likely unreachable from dispatched agents:
     ```
     Warning: hosted HA deployment has no explicit hub base URL; falling back to http://localhost:8080, which is unreachable from dispatched agents. Set SCION_SERVER_BASE_URL or server.hub.public_url.
     ```
4. **Synthetic Bootstrap Placeholders (GKE Two-Step Flow)**: During automated deployment sequences (such as GKE two-step bootstrap flow), you may need to spin up the Hub config before your GKE backend service (and its real IAP audience) is fully provisioned. If the Hub detects that the `audience` looks like a synthetic bootstrap placeholder (containing the word `placeholder`), it will emit a startup warning rather than failing-closed:
   ```
   Warning: IAP audience "/projects/1234/global/backendServices/placeholder" looks like a synthetic bootstrap placeholder. This is supported to facilitate GKE bootstrap, but you must update this configuration with your live IAP audience once provisioned.
   ```
   This allows the Hub to start up, register with local databases/brokers, and complete initial bootstrap before the final GCLB resource is available.
:::

#### Issuer and JWKS overrides

The defaults match Google's production IAP:

| Field | Default |
|-------|---------|
| `issuer` | `https://cloud.google.com/iap` |
| `jwks_url` | `https://www.gstatic.com/iap/verify/public_key-jwk` |

Override these only for testing with a mock IAP issuer.

### User provisioning

Provisioning in proxy mode works identically to OAuth — lazy, allow-list-gated, auto-create on first verified request:

- **`open`**: any verified email is allowed.
- **`domain_restricted`**: email domain must be in `authorized_domains`.
- **`invite_only`**: email must be pre-registered (via admin invite-code flow).
- **Roles**: Emails in `admin_emails` are granted the `admin` role automatically. Other new users get `server.auth.default_user_role` (`member` or `viewer`). An admin granted by `admin_emails` who is removed from the list is demoted to the default role; admins promoted through the Admin UI/API are not. See [Hub roles](/scion/hosted/ha/permissions/#hub-roles) and [AdminEmails and UI-promoted admins](/scion/hosted/ha/permissions/#adminemails-and-ui-promoted-admins).
- If not permitted, the request returns **403**. Deleted users are rejected with **401** or **403**, and suspended users are rejected with **403** (even though upstream IAP may authenticate them).
- **Database-Backed Token Refresh**: The token refresh endpoint reads the user's active role directly from the database rather than relying on stale session cache, ensuring UI-based role promotions take effect immediately.

A **60-second resolution cache** (keyed by verified email) avoids a database lookup on every request. The JWT signature is verified on every request — only the provisioning/store lookup is cached.

### Logout behavior

In proxy mode, the Hub does not own the session. The `/auth/logout` endpoint:

- **Browser requests**: redirect to `/_gcp_iap/clear_login_cookie` (IAP's cookie-clearing endpoint).
- **API requests**: return `200 OK` with `{"success": true, "message": "proxy mode: session is managed by the authenticating proxy"}`.

The browser redirect is the same for every proxy provider. With `provider: jwt`, `/_gcp_iap/clear_login_cookie` is a path on your own proxy, so sign-out depends on how that proxy handles it.

## Generic JWT proxy provider

Use `provider: jwt` when the Hub sits behind a bespoke authenticating proxy rather than Google IAP. The proxy must forward a JWT signed with an asymmetric key. The Hub verifies the signature, validates the claims, and then provisions the user exactly as described in [User provisioning](#user-provisioning). The [middleware precedence](#middleware-precedence) is the same as for IAP.

```yaml
server:
  auth:
    mode: proxy
    proxy:
      provider: jwt
      jwt:
        header: X-Auth-Proxy-JWT     # default
        algorithm: RS256             # required; asymmetric algorithms only
        issuer: https://auth.example.com
        audience: scion-hub

        # Exactly one key source:
        jwks_url: https://auth.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json
        # jwks_file: /etc/scion/proxy-jwks.json
        # public_key_file: /etc/scion/proxy-signing-key.pem

        # Optional claim mapping (OIDC-standard defaults shown):
        claims:
          email: email
          subject: sub
          display_name: name
          domain: hd
    user_access_mode: domain_restricted
    authorized_domains:
      - example.com
```

### Key sources

Configure exactly one key source. If none or more than one is set, the Hub refuses to start.

| Key source | Behavior |
|------------|----------|
| `public_key_file` | A single PEM public key (PKIX, PKCS1, or an X.509 certificate), read at startup and applied to every token regardless of `kid`. |
| `jwks_url` | A remote JWKS endpoint. Keys are matched by `kid` and cached. The cache refreshes hourly in the background and immediately when a token carries an unknown `kid`. Fetches are debounced to at most one attempt every 5 seconds. If a refresh fails, the last-good key set is still served. This matches the IAP provider. |
| `jwks_file` | A local JWKS JSON document, read at startup. Keys are matched by `kid`, and keys without a `kid` are ignored. The file must contain at least one usable keyed entry. Changes take effect only after a restart. |

Missing or malformed key files are reported at startup, not on the first request.

### Validation rules

- **Algorithm pinning.** Only the configured `algorithm` is accepted. Symmetric (`HS*`) algorithms are rejected at startup.
- **Issuer and audience** are checked only when `issuer` and `audience` are set. Set both in production. Without an audience, the Hub accepts any token the proxy's key has signed, including tokens minted for other services.
- **Expiry.** `exp` is required. `exp` and `iat` (if present) are checked with ±30 seconds of clock skew.
- **Identity claims.** The email claim is required and is lowercased. If the subject claim is missing, the email is used as the subject. Display name and domain are optional.
- A request without the configured header falls through to the normal unauthenticated handling. A request whose header holds an invalid JWT is rejected.

As with IAP, the Hub must be reachable only through the proxy. Use network controls to keep clients from reaching it directly.

## Outbound: agent transport auth

When the Hub is behind IAP (or a Cloud Run invoker-only service), agents need a way to reach the Hub through the platform guard. This is solved with a **dual-layer credential model**:

| Layer | Header | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Outer (transport)** | `Authorization: Bearer <Google OIDC ID token>` <br/>*or*<br/> `Proxy-Authorization: Bearer <Google OIDC ID token>` | Satisfies the platform guard (IAP or Cloud Run invoker IAM check). Cloud Run native IAP fully supports `Proxy-Authorization`. |
| **Inner (app)** | `X-Scion-Agent-Token: <scion JWT>` | Existing Hub agent authentication. Carried as a custom header so it never collides with the outer header. |

### How it works

1. **Cold start (dispatch)**: The Hub mints an initial Google OIDC ID token (impersonating a dedicated transport service account) and includes it in the agent's dispatch payload as environment variables.
2. **Steady-state refresh**: The agent piggybacks on its existing scion-token refresh cycle. The refresh response includes a `tokens[]` array with both the new scion access token and a fresh OIDC transport token. The agent applies each token to the appropriate layer.
3. **Background ticker**: The agent-side client drives refresh on the shortest-lived token (transport tokens have a 5-minute refresh margin vs. the ~1h Google ID token TTL).

### Dispatch environment variables

When transport auth is configured, the Hub injects these environment variables into the agent container at dispatch time:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `SCION_TRANSPORT_TOKEN` | Initial Google OIDC ID token for the transport layer. |
| `SCION_TRANSPORT_AUDIENCE` | Audience the transport token was minted for (IAP client ID or hub URL). |
| `SCION_TRANSPORT_TOKEN_EXPIRY` | Expiry of the initial token, in RFC 3339 format. Bootstrap only: `sciontool init` removes it together with `SCION_TRANSPORT_TOKEN`, because it goes stale after the first refresh. |

`SCION_TRANSPORT_TOKEN` only bootstraps the agent. At startup, `sciontool init` writes it to `~/.scion/transport-token` (mode `0600`, owned by the agent user) and removes it from the environment that the harness and its child processes inherit. Children get `SCION_TRANSPORT_TOKEN_FILE`, which points at that file. Each token refresh rewrites the file, and every in-agent hub client (hooks, `sciontool` subcommands, the in-agent `scion` CLI) re-reads it when it changes. So these clients keep working after the initial token expires, which takes about an hour.

If `sciontool init` cannot write the file, it logs an error and leaves `SCION_TRANSPORT_TOKEN` in the environment. In-agent clients then use that value until it expires, and hub calls from child processes fail after about an hour. A file is used only when the agent was given a transport token (`SCION_TRANSPORT_TOKEN` or `SCION_TRANSPORT_TOKEN_FILE` is set); a stale file left in a persisted home is removed at startup when neither is set.

A root shell opened with `docker exec` or `kubectl exec` does not inherit `SCION_TRANSPORT_TOKEN_FILE`. Run `. ~/.scion/scion-env` (as the agent user, or with the agent's home path) to get the same hub environment as the harness. That file exports `SCION_TRANSPORT_TOKEN_FILE`.

On the Kubernetes runtime, `SCION_TRANSPORT_TOKEN` comes from the agent's per-agent Secret through `secretKeyRef`, not from a plain value in the Pod spec. See [Hub Transport Credential](/scion/hosted/ha/kubernetes/#hub-transport-credential). Other runtimes set it as a regular environment variable.

### Refresh response: `tokens[]` array

The agent token refresh endpoint (`POST /api/v1/agents/{id}/token/refresh`) returns a generalized `tokens[]` array alongside the legacy single-token fields for backward compatibility:

```json
{
  "token": "...",
  "expires_at": "2026-06-05T12:00:00Z",
  "tokens": [
    {
      "layer": "app",
      "type": "scion_access",
      "value": "...",
      "expiresIn": 900
    },
    {
      "layer": "transport",
      "type": "google_oidc",
      "value": "...",
      "expiresIn": 3600,
      "audience": "1234567890.apps.googleusercontent.com"
    }
  ]
}
```

The `transport` entry is only present when `auth.transport` is configured on the Hub. Old clients ignore `tokens[]`; new clients consume both layers.

If the Hub is configured to mint transport tokens but cannot mint one (for example, the Hub's service account has lost `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` on the transport SA), the refresh still succeeds with the app token, the `transport` entry is omitted, and the response carries a `transportError` field with a fixed, generic description. The underlying error stays in the Hub's logs. An agent that uses a hub-provided transport token logs the failure and records the transport outcome of each refresh (`refreshed`, `failed` or `absent`) in `~/.scion/transport-token.status`, which `sciontool doctor` reports. Agents that do not use a hub-provided transport token (metadata mode, or no transport) ignore transport entries and record nothing. An agent in a proxy mode that started without a transport token counts as using one: it records outcomes, and it adopts the first transport entry it receives. The file never contains a token, and it is removed with the transport token file when an agent starts without a transport token.

### Recovering with `reset-auth`

`scion agent reset-auth <agent>` also pushes a fresh transport token when the Hub mints them. The broker writes it to `~/.scion/transport-token` next to the agent token, and `sciontool init` reloads it straight away and records the outcome `reset`, so doctor no longer shows an earlier failed refresh as the latest event. A value that cannot be parsed is not adopted: the agent keeps its current credential, restores the file from it, and records the reset as failed. If the agent has no credential yet (it started without a transport token in a proxy mode), the file is removed instead. This recovers an agent whose transport token has already expired, since that agent's own refresh can no longer get through the platform guard. If the Hub cannot mint a transport token, the reset still replaces the agent token.

### Agents that started without a transport token

If the Hub cannot mint a transport token at dispatch time, the agent starts without one. The Hub still sets `SCION_TRANSPORT_MODE` whenever it is configured to mint transport tokens. In a proxy mode (`iap` or `cloudrun_invoker`), such an agent adopts the first transport token it receives later, either from a token refresh or from `reset-auth`. That token is written to `~/.scion/transport-token` through the same path as a normal refresh, and it is picked up without a restart: sciontool's hub clients (including the long-lived one in the agent's init process) re-read the file, and every new in-agent hub client uses it, including clients created by processes that were already running. Until then, requests carry no transport header, and `sciontool doctor` reports that no transport credential has been received. Because the platform guard usually blocks the agent's own refresh until it has a credential, `reset-auth` is the usual way to recover. Without a proxy mode, the agent ignores a transport token that arrives after start.

### Diagnosing with `sciontool doctor`

Inside the agent, `sciontool doctor` has a **Transport Auth** section that shows:

- the header mode (`SCION_TRANSPORT_MODE`) and the header it uses, plus a shortened form of the audience (enough to spot a mismatch);
- which credential is in use (the refreshed file or the bootstrap value) and when it expires. The check fails if that credential has expired, cannot be parsed, or none is available, and warns when it is within the refresh margin;
- the expiry of the bootstrap value and of the file side by side, and when the file was last written;
- the transport outcome of the last refresh, or of the last `reset-auth`.

Doctor never prints token values. Its authentication checks tell a rejection by the platform proxy (a non-JSON 401/403, or a redirect to Google sign-in) apart from a rejection by the Hub (a JSON error), and the remediation differs: for a proxy rejection, run `reset-auth` and check the transport mode and audience; for a Hub rejection, the agent token itself is invalid. Doctor does not follow redirects. Redirects are shown only as their scheme and host, never with their query string. A redirect to any other host means authentication could not be confirmed, and it counts as a failed check; it usually means `SCION_HUB_ENDPOINT` is not the hub's final URL. A 404 on `/healthz` can come from the platform rather than the Hub, since some platforms (for example Cloud Run) reserve that path.

### Agent-side token source selection

The agent (`pkg/sciontool/hub`) selects an OIDC token source automatically:

1. **`SCION_TRANSPORT_TOKEN_FILE` or `SCION_TRANSPORT_TOKEN` set** → **Injected mode**: reads the refreshed file, with the env value as bootstrap fallback. The hub-provided token from dispatch is refreshed via `tokens[]` on subsequent refresh calls and shared with other processes through the file. Whichever of the file and the env value expires later is used. Outside a proxy mode, the file alone does not select this mode.
2. **Running on GCP (metadata server available)** → **Metadata mode**: fetches OIDC from the GCE metadata server using the ambient SA identity (the PR #307 pattern). Audience is set via `SCION_HUB_OIDC_AUDIENCE` or defaults to the hub URL.
3. **`SCION_TRANSPORT_MODE` is a proxy mode (`iap` or `cloudrun_invoker`)** → **File-backed mode with no bootstrap value**, for an agent that started without a transport token. The `sciontool` hub client always selects this mode in a proxy mode. It sends no transport header until a refresh or `reset-auth` delivers a token, which is then written to `~/.scion/transport-token`. Other clients built with `transportauth.FromEnv`, such as the in-agent `scion` CLI and doctor, select it only once that file exists. See [Agents that started without a transport token](#agents-that-started-without-a-transport-token).
4. **None of the above** → No OIDC transport (agent uses plain HTTP).

The header follows `SCION_TRANSPORT_MODE` in every in-agent client: `iap` sends `Proxy-Authorization`, `cloudrun_invoker` sends `X-Serverless-Authorization`, and anything else sends `Authorization`.

Injected mode (option 1) is the recommended path for IAP deployments — it decouples agent transport auth from the agent's own GCP identity.

### Transport configuration

```yaml
server:
  auth:
    transport:
      # Transport auth mode:
      #   none (default) — no transport tokens issued
      #   cloudrun_invoker — audience = hub URL
      #   iap — audience = IAP OAuth client ID
      mode: iap

      # OIDC audience for the transport token.
      # For IAP:              the IAP OAuth client ID (e.g., "1234567890.apps.googleusercontent.com")
      # For cloudrun_invoker: the hub URL (auto-derived from hub.public_url if empty)
      oidc_audience: "1234567890.apps.googleusercontent.com"

      # Dedicated service account for transport-layer auth.
      # The hub's runtime SA impersonates this SA to mint OIDC ID tokens.
      platform_auth_sa: "scion-transport@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
```

#### What audience to set

| Transport mode | `oidc_audience` value |
|---------------|----------------------|
| `iap` | The **IAP OAuth client ID** (found in Cloud Console → Security → IAP → your backend → OAuth client). Format: `<client-id>.apps.googleusercontent.com` |
| `cloudrun_invoker` | The **Hub's URL** (e.g., `https://hub.example.com`). If left empty, derived from `hub.public_url`. |

:::caution[Audience Decoupling]
`server.auth.transport.oidc_audience` and `server.auth.proxy.iap.audience` are intentionally decoupled and **must differ**:
- `server.auth.proxy.iap.audience` is the Cloud Run native IAP audience path (e.g. `/projects/<number>/locations/<region>/services/<service>`) or GCE/GKE backend service audience path, which is used for validating incoming IAP-signed JWTs.
- `server.auth.transport.oidc_audience` is the IAP OAuth client ID (e.g., `<client-id>.apps.googleusercontent.com`), which is used for minting OIDC tokens for dispatched agents and brokers to traverse IAP. IAP requires the OAuth client ID format for validating these tokens, not the Cloud Run resource path.
:::

:::note
When both IAP and Cloud Run invoker guards are present on the same service, the IAP service agent carries the Cloud Run invoker role automatically. Agents send a single outer token targeting the IAP audience — no three-layer case.
:::

### Hub-managed transport SA (Option C)

The Hub uses a dedicated service account solely for transport-layer auth. The Hub's runtime SA impersonates this SA via the IAM Credentials API (`generateIdToken`) to mint OIDC ID tokens for agents. This design:

- Keeps the auth-grade minting capability in the Hub only — agents hold no SA credential.
- Works regardless of the agent's GCP metadata mode (`block`, `passthrough`, or `assign`).
- Avoids distributing service account key files.

**Required IAM bindings:**

| Principal | Role | Target |
|-----------|------|--------|
| Hub's runtime SA | `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` | Transport SA (`platform_auth_sa`) |
| Transport SA | IAP-secured web user **or** Cloud Run invoker | The Hub's backend service |

### Seeing requests IAP rejects

When IAP enforces access directly on a Cloud Run service (for example, the IAP proxy in front of a single-node Hub), a request IAP rejects never reaches the container. It does not appear in the Cloud Run service's logs or the Hub's logs. To see IAP's own authorization decisions, enable **Data Access** audit logs (**Data Read**) for the `iap.googleapis.com` service, then filter Cloud Logging on `protoPayload.serviceName="iap.googleapis.com"` and `protoPayload.authorizationInfo.granted=false`. A mismatched `auth.proxy.iap.audience` is different: IAP passes the request through and the Hub rejects it, so it does show up in the Hub's logs. For step-by-step Console and `auditConfigs` instructions, see [Requests IAP rejects never reach Cloud Run or the Hub logs](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/scion/blob/main/docs/deploy/single-node-vm.md#requests-iap-rejects-never-reach-cloud-run-or-the-hub-logs) in the repository.

## Security notes

1. **Only the signed assertion is trusted.** The unsigned `X-Goog-Authenticated-User-Email` and `X-Goog-Authenticated-User-Id` headers are completely ignored.
2. **Audience binding is mandatory.** Without it, a JWT minted for a different IAP-protected service would be accepted. The `auth.proxy.iap.audience` field must always be set.
3. **The Hub must be reachable only through IAP for the human surface.** Any path that reaches the Hub directly could bypass proxy authentication. The verified-JWT path is safe against header spoofing (forged assertions fail the signature check), but direct access bypasses IAP entirely. Use VPC networking, firewall rules, or Cloud Run ingress settings to enforce this.
4. **JWKS key rotation** is handled automatically: keys are cached with hourly background refresh and on-miss refresh for rotated key IDs. Transient JWKS endpoint failures are tolerated by serving the last-good key set.
5. **Clock skew** of ±30 seconds is allowed on `exp` and `iat` claims.
6. **Suspended users** are rejected at the provisioning layer even though IAP still authenticates them upstream.

## End-to-end GCP setup checklist

### Prerequisites

- A GCP project with billing enabled.
- The Hub deployed on Cloud Run (or behind a GCE/GKE load balancer).
- `gcloud` CLI configured with appropriate permissions.

### 1. Enable IAP and create an OAuth consent screen

```bash
# Enable the IAP API
gcloud services enable iap.googleapis.com

# Configure the OAuth consent screen (if not already done)
# Go to: Console → APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen
```

### 2. Enable IAP on the backend service

```bash
# For Cloud Run behind a load balancer:
gcloud iap web enable \
  --resource-type=backend-services \
  --service=YOUR_BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME
```

Note the **IAP OAuth client ID** (found in Console → Security → IAP → your backend → click the three dots → Edit OAuth Client). You will need this client ID for `auth.transport.oidc_audience` (it is used for minting OIDC tokens).

Note the **signed header JWT audience** (found in Console → Security → IAP → your backend). This goes into `auth.proxy.iap.audience` (used for validating incoming human and browser requests).

:::caution[Audience Separation]
Do **not** use the same value for both. `auth.proxy.iap.audience` requires the Cloud Run/GCE/GKE native service path (e.g. `/projects/...`), while `auth.transport.oidc_audience` requires the OAuth client ID (e.g. `<client-id>.apps.googleusercontent.com`). Using the same audience for both will cause preflight checks and token verification to fail.
:::

### 3. Create the transport service account

```bash
# Create a dedicated SA for transport auth
gcloud iam service-accounts create scion-transport \
  --display-name="Scion Transport Auth"

# Grant the Hub's runtime SA permission to impersonate the transport SA
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding \
  scion-transport@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
  --member="serviceAccount:HUB_RUNTIME_SA@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator"
```

### 4. Grant the transport SA access to the platform guard

For **IAP**:
```bash
# Grant IAP-secured web user access to the transport SA
gcloud iap web add-iam-policy-binding \
  --resource-type=backend-services \
  --service=YOUR_BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME \
  --member="serviceAccount:scion-transport@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/iap.httpsResourceAccessor"
```

For **Cloud Run invoker**:
```bash
gcloud run services add-iam-policy-binding YOUR_SERVICE_NAME \
  --member="serviceAccount:scion-transport@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/run.invoker" \
  --region=YOUR_REGION
```

### 5. Configure the Hub

Create or update the `settings.yaml`:

```yaml
schema_version: "1"
server:
  mode: hosted
  hub:
    public_url: "https://hub.example.com"
    admin_emails:
      - admin@example.com
  auth:
    mode: proxy
    proxy:
      provider: iap
      iap:
        audience: "/projects/123456789/global/backendServices/987654321"
    transport:
      mode: iap
      oidc_audience: "1234567890.apps.googleusercontent.com"
      platform_auth_sa: "scion-transport@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
    user_access_mode: domain_restricted
    authorized_domains:
      - example.com
  database:
    driver: postgres
    url: "postgres://..."
```

### 6. Verify

1. Access the Hub URL in a browser — IAP should prompt for Google login, then the Hub should show your identity.
2. Dispatch an agent and verify it can communicate back to the Hub (check agent logs for OIDC transport messages, or run `sciontool doctor` inside the agent).
3. Check Hub logs for `Proxy auth configured: provider=iap` and `Transport auth configured: mode=iap` at startup.

### Reference scripts

The `scripts/cloudrun/` directory on the `pr/cloudrun-hub` branch contains reference deployment scripts (deploy.sh, entrypoint.sh, hub-settings-template.yaml) for a Cloud Run + IAP topology that can serve as a starting point.

### Cloud Run IAP reverse proxy (VPC-fronting)

If your Scion Hub runs on a private GCE VM (or any internal VPC service) and you want to front it with IAP via Cloud Run, the `extras/cloudrun-iap-proxy/` directory provides a lightweight Go reverse proxy purpose-built for this topology:

```text
[User Browser / Client]
        │ (HTTPS)
[Cloud Run (IAP Proxy)]
        │ (Direct VPC Egress / Private IP)
  [Scion Hub (GCE VM)]
```

Key features:

- **IAP header preservation** — forwards `X-Goog-IAP-JWT-Assertion` and authenticated-user headers to the backend Hub.
- **HTTP/2 cleartext (h2c) support** — uses `h2c` for multiplexed streaming over Cloud Run, which is critical for SSE connections (agent events, live dashboard updates).
- **Health probe** — exposes `/proxy-healthz` for Cloud Run health checks without proxying to the backend.
- **Direct VPC Egress ready** — deploy with Cloud Run Direct VPC Egress to reach internal compute instances on private RFC 1918 IPs.

The directory includes a Dockerfile, deploy script, and unit tests. See the `README.md` in `extras/cloudrun-iap-proxy/` for configuration and deployment instructions.

## Interactive CLI sessions (scion attach) via IAP

Connecting an interactive terminal to a running agent's session (`scion attach <agent-name>`) when the Hub is behind IAP requires tunneling through the Google platform guard.

### Dual-layer Authentication Bypass

Because IAP is a transport-layer security mechanism, authenticating via the CLI in IAP-protected environments utilizes a dual-layer authentication model:
1. **Outer Transport Layer**: Google OIDC ID token matching the IAP Client ID audience. This satisfies the Google IAP proxy check and allows the WebSocket request to reach the Hub.
2. **Inner App Layer**: Existing Hub authentication (such as a User Access Token (UAT) / PAT) carried as a custom WebSocket protocol header.

### App-Token Gate Bypassing

Previously, `scion attach` would enforce the existence of an application-level token *before* attempting transport-auth resolution. Since proxy/IAP mode operates by validating credentials at the transport level (with the Hub deriving identity from the `X-Goog-IAP-JWT-Assertion` header inserted by IAP), requiring a separate application-level token at the CLI gate blocked fully-authenticated IAP connections.

The `scion attach` flow resolves transport-layer authentication **before** checking the application-level token gate:
- If a valid transport auth token source is configured and resolved (e.g., your local Google Cloud SDK identity or GKE Workload Identity can authenticate to IAP), the application-level token requirement is bypassed.
- If no transport source is configured, the command falls back to requiring a standard Hub access token (via `scion hub auth login` or `SCION_HUB_TOKEN`).

This unblocks seamless interactive attachments to agents executing under IAP-secured Hubs.

## Brokers behind IAP

When the Hub is behind IAP, **Runtime Brokers** must also carry a transport-layer OIDC token on every request — just like agents do. However, brokers are long-lived *originators*: nothing injects a transport token into them, so they must mint their own OIDC tokens from their runtime identity (GKE Workload Identity or ambient GCE service account).

This section covers the deployment and configuration steps to connect brokers to an IAP-protected Hub.

### Custom OAuth 2.0 Client ID requirement

The Google-managed OAuth client that Cloud Run auto-provisions when IAP is enabled **does not support programmatic (service-account) authentication**. This means brokers (and any other machine client) cannot use it to mint OIDC tokens.

You must:

1. **Create a custom OAuth 2.0 Client ID** in the Google Cloud Console under **APIs & Services → Credentials → Create Credentials → OAuth client ID** (application type: Web application).
2. **Bind the custom client ID to the IAP settings** for your Hub's backend service (Console → Security → IAP → select backend → Edit OAuth Client → Use custom client).

The custom client ID (e.g., `1234567890-abc.apps.googleusercontent.com`) becomes the **OIDC audience** for all machine clients — both agents and brokers.

:::note
This is the same audience value used in `auth.transport.oidc_audience` in the Hub's `settings.yaml`. See [Transport configuration](#transport-configuration) above.
:::

### Broker Workload Identity setup

Brokers running in GKE use [Workload Identity](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity) to mint OIDC tokens from the GCE metadata server.

1. **Create a Google Service Account (GSA)** for brokers:
   ```bash
   gcloud iam service-accounts create scion-broker \
     --display-name="Scion Broker"
   ```

2. **Grant the GSA access to traverse the platform guard.** The required role depends on the transport mode:

   | Transport mode | Role | Target |
   |---|---|---|
   | `iap` | `roles/iap.httpsResourceAccessor` | Hub backend service |
   | `cloudrun_invoker` | `roles/run.invoker` | Hub Cloud Run service |

   For IAP:
   ```bash
   gcloud iap web add-iam-policy-binding \
     --resource-type=backend-services \
     --service=YOUR_BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME \
     --member="serviceAccount:scion-broker@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
     --role="roles/iap.httpsResourceAccessor"
   ```

3. **Bind the broker's Kubernetes Service Account (KSA) to the GSA** via the Workload Identity annotation:
   ```bash
   # Allow the KSA to impersonate the GSA
   gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding \
     scion-broker@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
     --member="serviceAccount:PROJECT_ID.svc.id.goog[NAMESPACE/BROKER_KSA_NAME]" \
     --role="roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser"

   # Annotate the KSA
   kubectl annotate serviceaccount BROKER_KSA_NAME \
     --namespace NAMESPACE \
     iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account=scion-broker@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
   ```

The broker can now mint OIDC ID tokens for the configured audience via the metadata server, which the transport layer uses automatically.

### Broker transport configuration

Broker transport auth has two configuration layers: **environment variables** (for containerized brokers in Kubernetes) and **credentials-file fields** (for per-connection config).

#### Environment variables

Set these on the broker's Kubernetes Deployment:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `SCION_TRANSPORT_MODE` | Transport mode: `iap` or `cloudrun_invoker` |
| `SCION_TRANSPORT_AUDIENCE` | OIDC audience — the custom OAuth 2.0 Client ID (for `iap` mode) or the Hub URL (for `cloudrun_invoker` mode) |

```yaml
env:
  - name: SCION_TRANSPORT_MODE
    value: "iap"
  - name: SCION_TRANSPORT_AUDIENCE
    value: "1234567890-abc.apps.googleusercontent.com"
```

#### Credentials-file fields

The broker credentials file (`~/.scion/hub-credentials/<name>.json`, written by `scion runtime-broker register`) can also store transport settings per hub connection:

```json
{
  "brokerId": "...",
  "secretKey": "...",
  "hubEndpoint": "https://hub.example.com",
  "transportMode": "iap",
  "transportAudience": "1234567890-abc.apps.googleusercontent.com"
}
```

**Environment variables override credentials-file values.** This allows Kubernetes Deployment manifests to set transport config declaratively while the credentials file retains the values persisted at registration time.

:::tip[Multi-hub brokers]
Per-connection placement in the credentials file exists for the **multi-hub scenario**: each hub connection can have its own `transportMode` and `transportAudience` (different IAP OAuth client IDs). A single broker can serve both IAP-protected and plain hubs simultaneously. See [Multi-Broker Setup](/scion/hosted/ha/multi-broker/) for details.
:::

### Broker registration without PAT (proxy-auth mode)

With transport auth configured, `scion runtime-broker register` works through IAP natively — no Personal Access Token (PAT) or hub token is needed. The broker authenticates via the IAP assertion of its service account identity.

When the Hub is in `proxy` auth mode and the broker has a valid transport token source (Workload Identity), the registration command:

1. Sends the OIDC transport token in the `Authorization` header to traverse IAP.
2. IAP verifies the token and passes the request through to the Hub.
3. The Hub identifies the caller via the IAP assertion (`X-Goog-IAP-JWT-Assertion`) and completes the registration.

This retires the manual `install-broker.sh` curl-from-a-pod workaround.

The `register` command also persists `transportMode` and `transportAudience` into the credentials file automatically, so the broker daemon inherits them on startup.

### Registering the broker Deployment

Instead of manual shell scripts, run the registration in the broker pod itself. `scion runtime-broker register` first checks that the broker server answers on its local port, so it has to run where the broker is reachable on `localhost`. The broker pod already has the broker's KSA (with Workload Identity) and the transport environment variables, and writes the credentials to the broker's own `~/.scion` volume:

```bash
kubectl -n scion exec -it deploy/scion-broker -- \
  scion runtime-broker register --global \
    --hub https://hub.example.com \
    --name my-broker \
    --transport-mode iap \
    --transport-audience "1234567890-abc.apps.googleusercontent.com"
```

Answer the confirmation prompts in the terminal. (`--yes` accepts every prompt, including adding the broker as a provider for a Hub project named `global`, which is created if it does not exist.) The CLI flags persist the transport values to the credentials file, so the broker inherits them on later starts. Add `--port <port>` if the broker does not listen on 9800.

Keep the broker's `~/.scion` on a persistent volume, so the credentials survive pod restarts. If the broker started without a Hub endpoint configured, restart it after registering (`kubectl -n scion rollout restart deploy/scion-broker`) so it connects with the new credentials.

### GKE deployment summary

| Step | What |
|---|---|

| 2 | Create a broker GSA; grant `roles/iap.httpsResourceAccessor` on the Hub backend service |
| 3 | Bind KSA ↔ GSA via Workload Identity annotation on the broker's Kubernetes service account |
| 4 | Broker Deployment env: `SCION_TRANSPORT_MODE=iap`, `SCION_TRANSPORT_AUDIENCE=<custom client id>` |
| 5 | One-time `scion runtime-broker register` in the broker pod (same KSA) — no curl scripts |
