title: Hub Setup on GCE
description: Deploy a Scion Hub on a Google Compute Engine VM using the Developer Hub scripts or the binary-release single-node VM script.
---

## Overview

The quickest path to a deployed Scion Hub that builds from source is a single Google Compute Engine VM using the Developer Hub scripts in `scripts/starter-hub/`. These scripts automate VM provisioning, repository setup, TLS configuration, and Hub startup.

## Prerequisites

- A **GCP project** with billing enabled.
- The **gcloud CLI** installed and configured (`gcloud auth login`, project set).
- A **domain name** whose DNS is delegated to Cloud DNS. The default path obtains a wildcard certificate for it through a DNS-01 challenge. Without a public domain, follow [Internal Deployments (BYO TLS)](#internal-deployments-byo-tls) instead.

## Configuration

Every script sources `scripts/starter-hub/hub-config.sh`. That file generates nothing. It is a shared set of shell variables that sets resource names, domains, and file paths from `HUB_NAME` (default `demo`) and `BASE_DOMAIN` (default `scion-ai.dev`). Set those, and any other variable listed in `hub-config.sh`, such as `REGION` or `ZONE`, in your environment before you run a script. Set `CERT_EMAIL` in your environment to your own address; Let's Encrypt uses it for certificate notices. It has no default, and `gce-certs.sh` and `gce-demo-deploy.sh` stop with an error before changing anything if it is not set:

```bash
export HUB_NAME=demo
export BASE_DOMAIN=example.com    # the Hub is served at hub.demo.example.com
export CERT_EMAIL=admin@example.com
```

Then create the Hub environment file, which `gce-start-hub.sh --full` uploads to the VM as `hub.env`:

```bash
mkdir -p .scratch
cp scripts/starter-hub/hub.env.sample .scratch/hub-${HUB_NAME}.env
# Edit .scratch/hub-<name>.env with your values
```

:::caution[Choose who can sign in before you expose the Hub]
The default user access mode is `open`. Once OAuth is configured, any account that the identity provider accepts can sign in and gets an account with the default role (`member`). Before the Hub is reachable by others, restrict sign-in in `hub.env`:

- `SCION_SEED_SERVER_AUTH_AUTHORIZEDDOMAINS=example.com` allows only accounts from the listed domains.
- `SCION_SEED_SERVER_AUTH_USERACCESSMODE=invite_only` allows only invited or existing users (`domain_restricted` is the other non-default mode).

These set `server.auth.authorized_domains` and `server.auth.user_access_mode`. See [Who can sign in](/scion/hosted/single-node/auth/#who-can-sign-in-user-access-mode).
:::

## Deploy

Run all scripts from the repository root.

### All-in-one (recommended)

```bash
./scripts/starter-hub/gce-demo-deploy.sh
```

`gce-demo-deploy.sh` runs every step below in order, so for a first deployment it is the only command you need. Running the individual scripts afterwards repeats the same work.

### Individual steps

Run these one at a time instead of `gce-demo-deploy.sh` when you need to skip or re-run a single step, for example on an [internal deployment](#internal-deployments-byo-tls). Each script is what `gce-demo-deploy.sh` runs at that step.

| Step | Script | What it does |
|------|--------|--------------|
| 0 | `gce-demo-preflight.sh` | Checks local tools, the env file, GCP auth, APIs, IAM permissions, and DNS readiness. It changes nothing. |
| 1 | `gce-demo-provision.sh` | Creates the GCE VM, its service account, a firewall rule for tcp:80 and tcp:443, and, when `ENABLE_GKE=true`, a GKE cluster. |
| 2 | `gce-demo-telemetry-sa.sh` | Creates a service account for agent telemetry export. |
| 3 | `gce-demo-setup-repo.sh` | Clones the Scion repository on the VM. |
| 4 | `gce-certs.sh` | Creates the Cloud DNS managed zone if it is missing, points an A record for the Hub domain at the VM's external IP, and runs certbot on the VM to get a Let's Encrypt wildcard certificate (`*.<CERT_DOMAIN>`) through a DNS-01 challenge. It does not install or configure Caddy. |
| 5 | `gce-start-hub.sh --full` | Uploads `hub.env`, writes `settings.yaml` and the systemd unit, installs Caddy, writes a Caddyfile that serves the certbot certificate from step 4 and proxies to the Hub on port 8080, builds the web assets and the `scion` binary on the VM, and starts the Hub. |

The `settings.yaml` that step 5 writes turns on telemetry export and sets `telemetry.cloud.gcp_project_id` to the deployment project (`PROJECT_ID`), so the metrics dashboard in the web UI queries Cloud Monitoring in that project. Step 1 grants the VM's service account `roles/monitoring.viewer` so the Hub can read those metrics. A Hub deployed before this setting existed picks it up at the next `gce-start-hub.sh --full`; re-run `gce-demo-provision.sh` first so the VM's service account has `roles/monitoring.viewer`. See [Metrics & OpenTelemetry](/scion/hosted/single-node/metrics/) for the `telemetry` settings.

:::note[Internal or private deployments]
If your VM has no external IP, or TLS is terminated upstream by a load balancer, reverse proxy, or similar appliance, skip step 4 and see [Internal Deployments (BYO TLS)](#internal-deployments-byo-tls) below.
:::

### Updating a running Hub

```bash
./scripts/starter-hub/gce-start-hub.sh
```

Without `--full`, `gce-start-hub.sh` only pulls the latest code on the VM, rebuilds, restarts the Hub, and checks its health. Add `--full` again when you change `hub.env` or the generated configuration.

The final health check requests `https://<HUB_DOMAIN>/healthz` and verifies the TLS certificate, so it fails if the certificate is missing or not valid. For a self-signed or test certificate only, add `--insecure-health-check` (or set `HEALTH_CHECK_INSECURE=true`); the script then prints a warning that the certificate was not verified.

## Post-Setup

Once the Hub is running:

1. **Access the Web Dashboard** — Navigate to your domain (or the VM's external IP) in a browser.
2. **Create your first project** — Use the dashboard or `scion project create` from the CLI.
3. **Register a Runtime Broker** — Connect a machine to execute agents. See [Runtime Broker](/scion/hosted/ha/runtime-broker/) for details on registering your local machine or a remote VM.

For ongoing Hub administration (auth, permissions, observability), see the other guides in the Hub Administration section.

## Binary Release Deployment (single-node VM)

If you don't need to build from source, `scripts/single-node-vm/deploy.sh` stands up a Hub from a published GitHub Release instead. It creates a GCE VM with no public IP that runs the `scion` binary under systemd with embedded SQLite, plus a Cloud Run reverse proxy protected by Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP). The proxy image is built on the VM, pushed to the `cloud-run-source-deploy` Artifact Registry repository, and deployed with `--image`. The deployment does not upload source to Cloud Storage, so it works in organizations whose policies block `storage.googleapis.com`. Re-running the script is idempotent.

**IAP SSH firewall rule.** The `scion-hub-HUB_NAME-allow-iap-ssh` rule targets only the hub VM's network tag, not every VM on the network. Deployments made before this scoping have an unscoped rule. Re-running `deploy.sh` narrows that rule in place, but only once it confirms the tag is on the hub VM. Any other VM that relied on the old rule for IAP SSH loses that access and needs its own firewall rule.

```bash
./scripts/single-node-vm/deploy.sh                    # interactive wizard
./scripts/single-node-vm/deploy.sh --version v0.5.0   # pin a release
```

The wizard asks for the Hub name, region, machine size, disk size, chat plugins, container image source, admin email, and **update policy**.

**Headless installs.** Pass `--config <file>` to pre-answer the wizard from JSON. This is intended for non-interactive and agent-driven installs:

```bash
./scripts/single-node-vm/deploy.sh --config my-deploy-config.json
```

Fields in the file skip their prompt. Missing fields fall back to a prompt when a terminal is attached, or to defaults otherwise. With no terminal, a missing required field makes the script exit with an error rather than hang. See `scripts/single-node-vm/deploy-config.example.json` for every field, including `update_policy` and `release_channel`.

**Vertex AI out of the box.** The script enables the Vertex AI API (`aiplatform.googleapis.com`) and grants the VM service account `roles/aiplatform.user`. It then sets two things so agents can use that service account:

- `default_gcp_identity_mode: passthrough` in `settings.yaml`. This is the [hub-default GCP identity](/scion/hosted/ha/permissions/#hub-default-gcp-identity), so new agents on the Hub's embedded broker inherit the VM service account unless the create request or project sets a different identity. To turn this off, change the mode to `block` or `assign` in **Admin > Server Config > Agent Defaults**.
- `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` (the VM's project) and `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION` (`global`) as hub-scoped environment variables with injection mode `always`. The script only creates them if they are missing, so a redeploy never overwrites your edits. If this step fails, the script prints a warning and you can set them yourself with `scion hub env set --scope hub`.

Agents on the `antigravity` harness detect the metadata-server identity and select Vertex AI auth without a `gcloud-adc` file, so a fresh Hub runs Vertex AI inference with no manual credential setup.

**Automatic updates.** The script writes a `server.maintenance` section with `deployment_tier: binary`, so the Hub checks GitHub Releases on a schedule. It installs updates automatically (`auto`), shows an update banner in the admin UI (`notify`), or does neither (`disabled`). The release channel defaults to `nightly` unless you set it. See [Maintenance (`server.maintenance`)](/scion/reference/server-config/#maintenance-servermaintenance) for all fields.

**Verified downloads.** Releases publish a `SHA256SUMS` file. `deploy.sh` checks that the chosen release has one before creating any GCP resources, and verifies the `scion` binary and chat plugins against it before installing them. The Hub's automatic updater also verifies downloads and refuses to install a release that has no `SHA256SUMS` file. To deploy an older release built before checksums were published, set `ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_RELEASE=true` when running `deploy.sh`.

**Optional GKE runtime (hybrid tier).** Set `gke_target.name` and `gke_target.location` in the config file to attach an existing GKE cluster as a second, Kubernetes-based runtime alongside the VM's co-located Docker broker. The script also serves an NFS export from the VM and creates a PersistentVolumeClaim in the cluster, so agents on both runtimes share the same project [shared directories](/scion/reference/server-config/#shared-directory-storage-servershared_dir_storage). The tier is off by default. The script attaches to the cluster but never creates or deletes it, and the cluster must be in the same project. With the tier enabled, `container_images.source: build` is refused (GKE nodes cannot pull from the VM's local Docker store), and `user_access_mode` must be `invite_only` (the default) or `domain_restricted`. See [`docs/deploy/hybrid-tier.md`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/scion/blob/main/docs/deploy/hybrid-tier.md) for the full field list and teardown behavior.

For the full guide, including architecture, access patterns, and troubleshooting, see [`docs/deploy/single-node-vm.md`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/scion/blob/main/docs/deploy/single-node-vm.md). If an AI agent is running the deployment for you, point it at the step-by-step [agent deployment runbook](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/scion/blob/main/docs/deploy/agent-runbook-single-node-vm.md). The runbook covers GCP preflight checks, the questions to ask the user, config file generation, and troubleshooting.

## Internal Deployments (BYO TLS)

The steps above assume a public-facing VM with an external IP and public DNS. If your VM is internal-only — for example, on a private VPC with no external IP — the Hub works identically, but TLS must be provided by you or terminated upstream.

### What to skip

| Step | Script | Skip? |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1. Provision the VM | `gce-demo-provision.sh` | **No** — run the script as-is. It creates firewall rules for inbound HTTP/HTTPS (tcp:80, tcp:443) that are unnecessary if the VM is not publicly reachable; you can remove them afterward or let your network team manage internal firewall rules instead. |
| 4. DNS and certificates | `gce-certs.sh` | **Yes** — this script fetches the VM's external IP, creates public Cloud DNS records, and obtains Let's Encrypt certificates via DNS challenge. All of this requires a public IP and will fail without one. |

Steps 0, 2, and 3 work without modification. Step 5 needs a certificate and key at `/etc/letsencrypt/live/<CERT_DOMAIN>/fullchain.pem` and `privkey.pem`. The directory `/etc/letsencrypt/archive` must also exist; it may be empty. When `/etc/letsencrypt/live` exists, `gce-start-hub.sh --full` runs `chown -R` and `chmod -R` on both `live` and `archive` to give group `caddy` read access. The remote commands run under `set -euo pipefail`, so a missing `archive` directory stops the run before the Hub starts. The script then installs a Caddyfile that points at the certificate files and restarts Caddy when the Caddyfile changes; if the files are missing at that point, Caddy fails to start and the script stops before it starts the Hub.

To skip the Caddy/TLS step entirely, for example when TLS is terminated upstream ([Option B](#tls-options)), run `gce-start-hub.sh --full --no-tls` or set `SKIP_TLS=true`. The script then writes no Caddyfile, does not install or restart Caddy, and skips the final HTTPS health check; the health check on the VM still runs. The systemd unit sets `SCION_SERVER_BASE_URL` to `http://<HUB_DOMAIN>:8080` unless you set `HUB_BASE_URL`, and a `SCION_SERVER_BASE_URL` in `hub.env` takes precedence over both. The `http://` default is for a Hub reached directly on port 8080. Behind an upstream TLS terminator, set `SCION_SERVER_BASE_URL` in `hub.env` (or `HUB_BASE_URL`) to the `https://` URL that clients use. With `SKIP_TLS=true`, `gce-demo-deploy.sh` also skips step 4 and does not require `CERT_EMAIL`, so you can use the all-in-one script. Because step 4 is what creates the DNS record, nothing creates one for `HUB_DOMAIN` in this mode: it must resolve to the VM through your own DNS, or set `HUB_BASE_URL` or `SCION_SERVER_BASE_URL` to an address agents can reach. Without it, run the [individual steps](#individual-steps) and skip step 4.

### Set `SCION_SERVER_BASE_URL`

The Hub uses `SCION_SERVER_BASE_URL` to construct OAuth redirect URIs and set the session cookie's `Secure` flag. When step 4 is skipped, you must set this variable yourself.

In your `hub.env` file (see `scripts/starter-hub/hub.env.sample`):

```bash
# The URL that browsers and agents use to reach the Hub.
# Must include the scheme (https://) — the Hub derives cookie
# security from the URL scheme.
SCION_SERVER_BASE_URL=https://hub.internal.example.com
```

:::caution[HTTPS is strongly recommended]
If `SCION_SERVER_BASE_URL` uses `http://`, the Hub will not set the `Secure` flag on session cookies. Use `https://` in production even when TLS is terminated upstream.
:::

### TLS options

Choose the option that matches your environment:

**Option A — Caddy with your own certificates**

If you still want Caddy as a local reverse proxy but with your own certificate and key instead of Let's Encrypt, create a Caddyfile on the VM:

```caddy
hub.internal.example.com {
    tls /path/to/your/cert.pem /path/to/your/key.pem
    reverse_proxy localhost:8080
}
```

Then start Caddy manually (`sudo caddy start --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile`) instead of running `gce-certs.sh`. `gce-start-hub.sh --full` installs its own `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile`, which points at `/etc/letsencrypt/live/<CERT_DOMAIN>/`, and restarts Caddy when it changes. Before each `--full` run, place your certificate and key at that path as `fullchain.pem` and `privkey.pem`, and make sure `/etc/letsencrypt/archive` exists (it may be empty); otherwise the run stops before it starts the Hub. The script sets group `caddy` on both directories itself. Restore your own Caddyfile after each `--full` run, or keep the generated one if it serves your certificate.

**Option B — TLS terminated upstream**

If TLS is terminated by an upstream load balancer, reverse proxy, or appliance (e.g., an F5, nginx, or GCP HTTPS Load Balancer), no local TLS configuration is needed. The upstream proxy forwards plain HTTP to the Hub on port 8080. Ensure `SCION_SERVER_BASE_URL` is still set to the `https://` URL that clients use.

**Option C — Identity-Aware Proxy (GCP)**

For GCP deployments, you can front the Hub with [Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP)](/scion/hosted/ha/auth-proxy-iap/) instead of managing certificates directly. IAP handles both TLS and user authentication at the network edge. The IAP guide covers HA deployments but the same pattern works for a single VM behind an internal load balancer.
