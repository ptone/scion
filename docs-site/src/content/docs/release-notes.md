Scion release notes are published weekly.

## Latest: Week of September 28 -- October 4, 2026

Raw keystroke messaging was replaced by a dedicated agent keys API (`scion keys`), and raw message delivery is now removed. A timezone overhaul pinned servers, storage and APIs to UTC and made the Hub the only source of an agent's `TZ`. Agent delete became asynchronous and failure-aware, and asynchronous create arrived as an opt-in. Kubernetes gained per-agent NFS workspaces, Workload Identity and a new Substrate runtime. Security work continued with user access token boundaries, frozen delegation ceilings and project access granted only through role bindings.

## Timezone handling changes

During the week of September 28 ([release notes](/scion/release-notes/2026-09-28/)), timezone handling changed: the Hub sends every timestamp in UTC with `Z`, the web dashboard has a per-user display timezone and a 24-hour clock, and cron schedules are UTC only. The runtime-profile `timezone` setting introduced the week before ([release notes](/scion/release-notes/2026-09-21/)) has been removed: an agent's `TZ` now comes from its pin, `TZ` environment variables on the Hub, or the Hub default timezone. See [Times and Timezones](/scion/reference/times-and-timezones/) for the full behaviour and the operator steps after upgrading.

## Deleted built-in harness configs and templates stay deleted

A deleted built-in harness config (for example `claude`) or the built-in `default` template no longer comes back when the Hub restarts or is upgraded ([ptone/scion#3544](https://github.com/ptone/scion/issues/3544)). This also applies to harness configs left unselected in the setup wizard. The Hub records each built-in it has seeded in the `builtin_resources_seeded` Hub setting, and startup only creates built-ins that are not in that record. Built-ins that are new in a release are still added, and built-ins you keep still receive content updates.

To bring a deleted built-in harness config back, re-import it as a global harness config from its canonical URL, `https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/scion/harnesses/<name>` (for example `.../harnesses/claude`). Use the import box on the **Harness Configs** tab of the Hub's **Settings** page, or `POST /api/v1/resources/import`. On a hosted Hub, a copy imported from any other URL (such as a `/tree/<ref>/` URL), or a re-imported `default` template, is usable but user-managed: it does not receive the content bundled with later releases. Workstation Hubs update it either way. See [Recovering a deleted built-in](/scion/reference/harness-settings/#recovering-a-deleted-built-in).

Upgrade note: on the first start after upgrading, the Hub has no record yet, so built-ins you deleted since the last restart before the upgrade reappear once. Delete them again and they stay deleted.

## Migration guides

- [Migrating from raw message delivery](/scion/reference/raw-message-removal/): raw keystroke delivery through messages is removed. `scion message --raw` fails before sending anything, and any message request that still carries `raw` is refused with `422 raw_input_removed`. Use `scion keys` or `POST .../keys` instead.
- [Migrating from grove names](/scion/reference/grove-removal/): the grove→project rename.
