description: The scion artifact command and the /api/v1/artifacts routes for publishing files with stable references.
---

:::caution[Experimental]
Artifacts are behind the `hub.artifacts` experiment, which is **off by default**. While it is off, every `/api/v1/artifacts` route answers `404` and the web UI shows no artifact pages. An admin enables it under **Admin → Server Config → Experiments** (see [Experiments](/scion/reference/experiments/)). Artifacts require Hub mode.
:::

An **artifact** is a published file with a stable reference, `scion://artifact/<id>`, that works from any runtime broker, in any project the reader can access, and in the web UI. The hub stores the bytes, so a reader never needs access to the publisher's filesystem or shared directories.

This page covers what is available today: publishing a single file, fetching it, and the artifact page. Versions, bundles, message references, review and share links are planned.

## Ownership and access

- An artifact is **owned** by the agent or user that published it (recorded by stable id, never by name). The owner can always read it.
- It is **homed** in a project: an agent's own project, or the project a user publishes into. Members who may read in that project may read the artifact.
- Anyone else gets `404` — the same answer as for an artifact that does not exist, so responses do not reveal whether an artifact exists.
- Deleting the project does not delete its artifacts; the owner keeps access.

## `scion artifact`

Available in every CLI mode, including agent mode.

### `scion artifact publish <file>`

Publishes one file as a new artifact homed in the current project, and prints its reference and the URL of its web page.

```text
$ scion artifact publish design.md --title "Artifact system design"
scion://artifact/5f1c2d3e-6b1a-4c55-9f3e-0d6e7a1b2c3d  (v1)
https://hub.example.com/projects/<project-id>/artifacts/5f1c2d3e-6b1a-4c55-9f3e-0d6e7a1b2c3d
```

- `--title <title>`: Artifact title. Default: the file name.

The file must be a regular file no larger than the hub's per-file limit (32 MiB by default, setting `artifacts.max_file_bytes`). The CLI sends the file's SHA-256, and the hub rejects an upload that does not match it.

### `scion artifact get <ref>`

Fetches an artifact's entry file and writes it to stdout.

```text
$ scion artifact get scion://artifact/5f1c2d3e-6b1a-4c55-9f3e-0d6e7a1b2c3d > design.md
$ scion artifact get scion://artifact/5f1c2d3e-6b1a-4c55-9f3e-0d6e7a1b2c3d@1 --out ./docs/
```

- `<ref>`: `scion://artifact/<id>`, `scion://artifact/<id>@<seq>` for a specific version, or a bare `<id>`.
- `--out`, `-o <path>`: Write to this file instead of stdout. If the path is an existing directory, the file is written into it under its own name. The file is replaced atomically.

When it fetches the current version, `get` checks the bytes against the SHA-256 the hub recorded at publish time and fails on a mismatch.

## Web page

`/projects/<project-id>/artifacts/<id>` shows the artifact's title, owner, version and reference, and renders the entry file: Markdown as formatted text, text and code (including JSON, YAML, CSV) in a read-only editor, and PNG, JPEG, GIF and WebP images inline. Other types (including HTML, SVG and PDF) are offered as a download.

## API

All routes are under `/api/v1/artifacts` and use the hub's usual authentication (session, user access token or agent token). Errors use the hub's JSON error envelope.

| Method and path | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `POST /api/v1/artifacts?name=<file>[&title=<title>][&scope=<project-id>]` | Publish the raw request body as a new single-file artifact. `scope` defaults to the caller's project (agents); users must set it. Optional header `X-Content-SHA256` (hex) is verified. Returns `201` with the artifact and its first version. |
| `GET /api/v1/artifacts/{id}` | The artifact and its current version, including the file manifest (`path`, `size`, `sha256`, `mediaType`). |
| `GET /api/v1/artifacts/{id}/files/{path}` | A file of the current version. |
| `GET /api/v1/artifacts/{id}/versions/{seq}/files/{path}` | A file of version `seq`. |

Status codes: `400` for a malformed request, `401` unauthenticated, `403` when the caller may not publish in the scope, `404` for an absent or unreadable artifact, `413` when the file exceeds `artifacts.max_file_bytes` (rejected before anything is stored).

**File delivery.** On a hub with local storage the hub streams the bytes. On a hub with object storage (GCS) it answers `302` to a short-lived signed URL; add `?stream=1` to have the hub serve the bytes itself (the web page does this for text). Either way the response carries `Content-Disposition` (`inline` only for plain text, Markdown, CSV, JSON, YAML, TOML and raster images; `attachment` otherwise) and `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`; streamed responses also carry a sandboxing `Content-Security-Policy` and an `ETag`.

**Permissions.** Reading checks `artifact.read` in the artifact's home project; publishing checks `artifact.create` in the target project. Project owners, admins and members hold both for their project; changing, deleting or sharing an existing artifact is left to its owner. Agent tokens carry them through the `project:artifact:read` and `project:artifact:write` scopes: `readonly`, `baseline` and `full` agents can read, `baseline` and `full` agents can publish, and no agent can delete artifacts or manage their grants. An agent token without `project:artifact:read` gets `404` for every artifact, even one shared with it directly. Artifact access uses dedicated agent scopes; agents minted from pre-existing token ceilings need re-minting before they can use artifacts.
