title: Scion CLI Reference
---

The Scion CLI is the primary interface for managing agents, projects, and server components.

## Global Flags

These flags are available on all commands:

- `-g, --project <string>`: Project identifier: path, slug (with Hub), or git URL (with Hub).
- `--global`: Use the global project (equivalent to `--project global`).
- `-p, --profile <name>`: Configuration profile to use.
- `--format <string>`: Output format (`json` or `plain`).
- `--hub <url>`: Hub API endpoint URL (overrides `SCION_HUB_ENDPOINT`).
- `--no-hub`: Disable Hub integration for this invocation (local-only mode).
- `-y, --yes`: Skip confirmation prompts.
- `--non-interactive`: Full non-interactive mode (implies `--yes`, errors on ambiguous prompts).
- `--debug`: Enable verbose debug output.

The legacy hidden `--grove` flag has been removed from every command; passing it fails with
`unknown flag: --grove`. Use `--project`.

:::caution[`--gcp-project` on GCP commands]
On `scion project service-accounts add` and `scion hub secret migrate`, the GCP project ID is passed
with `--gcp-project`. On those commands `--project` is the global Scion project selector, and using
it for the GCP project ID fails with a hint pointing to `--gcp-project`.

:::tip[Decluttered CLI Help]
To keep subcommand help output clean and readable, global flags are hidden from default subcommand help outputs. You can view the full list of global flags anytime by running:

```bash
scion help global-flags

## Agent Lifecycle

### `scion start` (or `run`)

Starts a new agent or resumes an existing one. Starting a **suspended** agent
implicitly resumes its harness session (continuing the prior conversation);
starting a **stopped** or **error** agent runs a fresh session. See
[`scion suspend`](#scion-suspend) and [`scion resume`](#scion-resume).

**Usage:** `scion start <agent-name> [task] [flags]`

- **Arguments:**
    - `<agent-name>`: Unique name for the agent instance.
    - `[task]`: (Optional) The initial instruction/task for the agent.
- **Flags:**
    - `-b, --branch <string>`: Target branch for the agent workspace.
    - `-t, --type <string>`: Template to use (default "gemini").
    - `-i, --image <string>`: Override container image.
    - `-a, --attach`: Attach to the agent immediately after starting.
    - `--no-auth`: Disable authentication propagation.
    - `-d, --detached`: Run in detached mode (default true).
    - `--config <path>`: Path to inline agent config file (YAML/JSON) for Just-In-Time (JIT) overrides, or `-` for stdin.
    - `--harness-config <string>`: Named harness configuration to use.
    - `--harness-auth <string>`: Override auth method for the harness. Universal types: `api-key`, `oauth-token`, `vertex-ai`, `auth-file` (each harness accepts a subset — see [Harness Authentication](/scion/local/agent-credentials/)).
    - `--broker <string>`: Preferred runtime broker ID or name for execution.
    - `--message-mode <mode>`: Set the agent's initial message mode (`project`, `branch`, `lineage`, `none`, or `hub`). Defaults to `project`. See [Message Authorization & Modes](/scion/hosted/user/messaging/#message-authorization--modes).
    - `--notify`: Get notified via the browser or system when the spawned agent reaches a terminal state.

### `scion stop`

Stops a running agent. This is a graceful shutdown (`SIGTERM`); the agent's
phase becomes `stopped` and the next `start` runs a fresh session.

**Usage:** `scion stop <agent-name>`

### `scion suspend`

Suspends a running agent, preserving its harness session for a later resume.
Unlike `stop`, suspending sets the agent's phase to `suspended`, and the next
`start` (or `resume`) **continues** the prior conversation instead of starting
fresh.

Only running agents can be suspended, and the agent's harness must support
session resume (Claude Code and Gemini CLI do; the generic harness does not —
use `stop` instead). See [Agent Lifecycle](/scion/local/agent-lifecycle/).

**Usage:** `scion suspend <agent-name> [flags]`

- **Flags:**
    - `-a, --all`: Suspend all running agents in the current project. Agents
      whose harness does not support resume are skipped.

### `scion resume`

Resumes an existing agent. For a **suspended** agent, the harness session is
continued (Claude Code receives `--continue`, Gemini CLI `--resume`, etc.). For
a **stopped** agent, there is no session to continue, so a fresh session is
started.

A plain `scion resume <agent-name>` (no task) simply **continues** the prior
session — the agent's original creation task is *not* re-injected. If you pass an
explicit prompt, it is sent as a **new message** on top of the continued
session.

**Usage:** `scion resume <agent-name> [task] [flags]`

- **Flags:**
    - `-a, --attach`: Attach to the agent immediately.
    - `-f, --force`: Force resume an agent in the `error` phase. This attempts an in-place restart of a crashed or interrupted session, preserving the prior harness conversation state instead of starting fresh.

### `scion attach`

Connects to the interactive session of a running agent.

When connecting to a Hub behind Google Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP), `scion attach` automatically attempts to resolve transport-layer authentication (Google OIDC ID tokens) *before* evaluating the application-level access token gate. If transport auth can be successfully established (e.g., using your local Google Cloud SDK identity or GKE Workload Identity), the application token check is bypassed, enabling seamless attachment in proxy-auth/IAP mode.

If the agent is stopped, the attach ends immediately rather than waiting and retrying (see [PTY close codes](/scion/reference/api/#pty-close-codes)).

**Usage:** `scion attach <agent-name>`

- **Key Bindings:**
    - `Ctrl+P, Ctrl+Q`: Detach from the session without stopping the agent.

### `scion message` (or `msg`)

Sends a message to a running agent or user.

**Usage:** `scion message <recipient> <message> [flags]`

- **Recipients:**
    - `<agent-name>`: Send to an agent (default, same as `agent:<name>`).
    - `agent:<name>`: Send to an agent explicitly.
    - `user:<name>`: Send to a user's inbox. *(Hub mode only)*
    - `group[a,b,...]`: Send to multiple recipients. *(Hub mode only)*
    - `@<agent-name>`: Send to an agent's conversation (preferred).
    - `@<email>`: Send to a user by email (global DM).
    - `conv:<uuid>`: Send to a conversation by ID. *(Hub mode only)*
    - `#<thread>`: Send to a named thread. *(Hub mode only)*

- **Arguments:**
    - `<recipient>`: The recipient (see above).
    - `<message>`: The text to send.
- **Flags:**
    - `-i, --interrupt`: Interrupt the harness before sending the message.
    - `-w, --wake`: Resume a suspended agent before delivering the message.
    - `--body-file <path>`: Read the message body from a file instead of passing it inline. Useful for long messages and scripted workflows. Mutually exclusive with the inline `<message>` argument.
    - `--attach <path>`: Attach one or more file paths (repeatable). File paths must be within allowed roots (`/workspace` or `/scion-volumes`), where relative paths resolve against `/workspace`.
        - **Constraints:** Cannot be combined with `--raw`, `--in`, or `--at`.
        - **Requirements:** Requires Hub mode (`scion hub enable`). If run in local mode, the command will fail with an error suggesting you include file contents directly in the message text. If the file is not a regular file (e.g., is a directory) or is outside allowed roots, the command will fail.
    - `--cc <agents>`: *(Deprecated — will be removed.)* Carbon copy additional agents. This flag is **repeatable** and also accepts a **comma-separated list** of agent names (e.g., `--cc dev-agent,qa-agent --cc test-agent`). Use `group[...]` addressing or body `@mentions` instead.
    - `--notify`: *(Deprecated — use `scion notifications subscribe` instead.)* Get notified when the target agent(s) respond or reach a terminal state after receiving the message.
    - `--plain`: *(Deprecated — will be removed.)*  Mark for plain-text delivery.
    - `--channel <channel>`: *(Deprecated — use conversation addressing instead.)* Target a specific message channel (e.g., `telegram`, `gchat`, `teams`, `web`).
    - `--thread-id <id>`: *(Deprecated — use conversation addressing instead.)* Target a specific thread ID within the channel.
    - `--raw`: *(Deprecated — use `scion keys` instead.)* Send literal bytes via tmux send-keys with no trailing Enter.
    - `--in <duration>`: *(Deprecated — use `scion schedule create --in` instead.)* Schedule message delivery after a duration.
    - `--at <time>`: *(Deprecated — use `scion schedule create --at` instead.)* Schedule message delivery at an absolute time.

- **Message Body Formatting:**
  The command delivers the `<message>` argument **verbatim** — it performs no escape expansion, no markdown rendering, and no character substitution. Whatever bytes you pass are exactly what the recipient receives.
  
  To include newlines, use real newlines inside shell quoted strings or heredocs. Do **not** use JSON-encoded bodies or literal backslash-n (`\n`) sequences — those will appear as literal characters in the delivered message.

  * **Correct (real newlines in a quoted string):**
    ```bash
    scion message --non-interactive @reviewer "PR #42 is ready for review.

    Branch: fix/auth-bug
    CI: all green"
    ```

  * **Correct (heredoc for longer messages):**
    ```bash
    scion message --non-interactive @reviewer "$(cat <<'EOF'
    PR #42 is ready for review.

    Branch: fix/auth-bug
    CI: all green
    EOF
    )"
    ```

  * **Wrong (JSON-encoded body with literal `\n`):**
    ```bash
    # BAD: literal \n chars appear in the delivered message
    scion message --non-interactive @reviewer "PR #42 is ready for review.\n\nBranch: fix/auth-bug\nCI: all green"
    ```

### `scion broadcast`

Sends a message to all running agents in the current project (or across all projects).

**Usage:** `scion broadcast <message> [flags]`

This command replaces the removed `--broadcast` / `--all` flags on `scion message`.

### `scion keys`

Sends raw keystrokes to an agent's terminal via tmux `send-keys` with no trailing Enter. Supports control keys like arrows and Escape. Works for Hub-managed agents as well as local ones. When run by an agent, it can only target agents in the agent's own project — cross-project targets are refused; a human operator using `--project` can still target other projects. This command replaces the deprecated `--raw` flag on `scion message`.

**Usage:** `scion keys <agent-name> <keys>`

### `scion set-message-mode`

Sets the message mode for an agent, controlling which users and agents can send messages to it. Full-role agents can also call this command programmatically.

**Usage:** `scion set-message-mode <agent-name> <mode>`

- **Arguments:**
    - `<agent-name>`: The target agent.
    - `<mode>`: One of `project` (default), `branch`, `lineage`, `none`, or `hub`.

See [Message Authorization & Modes](/scion/hosted/user/messaging/#message-authorization--modes) for details on each mode. The `hub` mode enables [cross-project messaging](/scion/hosted/user/messaging/#cross-project-messaging).

### `scion messages` (aliases: `msgs`, `inbox`)

Manages bidirectional communication and persistent messages sent by agents to humans.

**Usage:** `scion messages [command] [flags]`

- **Commands:**
    - `list` (default): View unread messages.
    - `read <message-id>`: Mark a specific message as read.
    - `read-all`: Mark all messages as read.
- **Flags:**
    - `--agent <string>`: Filter messages by a specific agent.
    - `--all`: Show all messages, including those already marked as read.

### `scion conversation` (alias: `conv`)

Manages conversations — the surface-agnostic containers for message threads. Requires Hub mode. Running `scion conversation` without a subcommand defaults to `list`. It also works inside Hub-connected agent containers, as does `scion notifications`; this requires a harness image built from this release or later.

Conversations are referenced using one of three forms:

- `conv:<uuid>` — by conversation ID.
- `@<agent-name>` — resolves the direct conversation with the named agent.
- `#<thread-name>` — resolves a named group conversation.

**Usage:** `scion conversation [command] [flags]`

- **Commands:**
    - `list` (default): List conversations you participate in.
    - `get <conversation-ref>`: Show conversation details.
    - `get-message <conversation-ref> <message-id>`: Retrieve a single message by its ID from a conversation. Authorization is participant-based — only participants of the conversation can retrieve its messages.
    - `messages <conversation-ref>`: View messages in a conversation.
    - `create <name>`: Create a new group conversation. The group appears as a thread in the project's web chat space. Names must start with a letter or digit, contain only letters, digits, spaces, `_`, or `-`, and be at most 100 characters (returns `400 Bad Request` otherwise). A name already used in the project returns `409` (name conflict).
    - `set-default <conversation-ref> <agent-id>`: Set the default agent for a conversation.
    - `participants <conversation-ref>`: List participants in a conversation.
    - `join <conversation-ref> <principal-kind> <principal-id>`: Add a participant to a conversation.
    - `leave <conversation-ref>`: Leave a conversation.
    - `catch-up <conversation-ref>`: Show recent messages in a conversation.
- **Flags (on `list`):**
    - `--kind <string>`: Filter by kind (`direct`, `group`).
    - `--surface <string>`: Filter by surface (`native`, `discord`, `slack`, etc.).
    - `--project <string>`: Filter by project ID.
    - `--limit <int>`: Maximum number of conversations to show (default 50).
    - `--json`: Output in JSON format.
- **Flags (on `messages`):**
    - `--limit <int>`: Maximum number of messages to show (default 25).
    - `--before <time>`: Show messages before this time (RFC 3339).
    - `--after <time>`: Show messages after this time (RFC 3339).
    - `--json`: Output in JSON format.
- **Flags (on `create`):**
    - `--project <string>`: Project ID. Defaults to the Hub-linked project, then the local project. If no project resolves, the Hub falls back to the calling agent's project; a user caller with no project gets `400 projectId is required`.
    - `--json`: Output in JSON format.
- **Flags (on `catch-up`):**
    - `--since <duration>`: Show messages from this duration ago, e.g. `30m`, `2h` (default `1h`).
    - `--json`: Output in JSON format.
- **Flags (on `get-message`):**
    - `--json`: Output in JSON format.

### `scion logs`

Displays the logs of an agent.

**Usage:** `scion logs <agent-name> [flags]`

- **Flags:**
    - `-f, --follow`: Stream logs.

### `scion list` (or `ps`)

Lists all agents and their status.

**Usage:** `scion list [flags]`

- **Flags:**
    - `-a, --all`: Show all agents (including stopped ones).
    - `-r, --running`: Filter for active (running) agents.
    - `--phase <phase>`, `--activity <activity>`, `--template <name>`, `--label <key=value>` (repeatable): Filter by attribute. Combine with each other using AND.
    - `--owner <user>` (Hub mode only): Filter by owner — a user ID, name, email, or the reserved value `me` (a user whose display name is literally "me" cannot be matched by name; use their ID or email). Owner is the direct creator (`createdBy`), which for an agent-created agent is another **agent**, not the human at the root of the tree — `--owner alice` does not include agents created by alice's agents, and `--owner me` when authenticated with an agent token means "agents I directly created."
    - `--broker <name|id>` (Hub mode only): Filter by runtime broker name or ID.
    - `--harness <harness-config name>` (Hub mode only): Filter by harness-config name.
    - `--descendants[=<agent>]` (Hub mode only): List every agent descended from the reference. With no value, the reference is the calling agent in agent mode, or the calling user otherwise (a user's ID is recorded as the creator in its directly-created agents' ancestry, so this still works).
    - `--ancestors[=<agent>]` (Hub mode only): List the agents named in the reference's ancestry chain (entries that name a user rather than an agent are skipped). Same reference-resolution rule as `--descendants`. A user reference has no ancestry, so this returns an empty list when the reference defaults to the calling user.
    - `--lineage[=<agent>]` (Hub mode only): List the reference's **creation-tree neighborhood** — the reference's direct parent agent, plus everything created (at any depth) from that parent — bounded to the reference's own project. The exact root rule: it roots at itself when it was created directly by a user, has no recorded parent at all, **or its only recorded parent is an agent you cannot list** (without `--all`, that includes a parent that is merely in a different project — the lookup for a length-one ancestry goes through the current project's endpoint, not the global one). For a deeper ancestry (two or more recorded ancestors), the direct parent is always used as the root even if you cannot see it yourself, so its other children (your siblings) that you *can* see are still listed — this is safe because the ancestry length alone already proves that entry is an agent, not a user. Same reference-resolution rule as `--descendants`. For a user reference (e.g. bare `--lineage` in human/assistant mode with no agent to infer), there is no project to bound to, so the result is identical to `--descendants` for that user: every agent they've created, at any depth, across whatever project scope is already in effect. **This is a creation-tree query, not a messaging-permission query** — it does not reflect who the reference agent is allowed to message under its message mode (`scion set-message-mode`), which can be a different and smaller set.
    - `--descendants`, `--ancestors`, and `--lineage` are mutually exclusive with each other. All of the above combine with `--phase`/`--activity`/`--template`/`--label` using AND.
    - Without `--all`, every Hub-mode filter above (including `--descendants`/`--ancestors`/`--lineage`) is scoped to the **current project** — a reference agent's ancestors/descendants/lineage in a different project will not appear. From a human or assistant shell, `--all` searches across every project you can see. **When authenticated with an agent token, `--all` cannot be combined with `--descendants`/`--ancestors`/`--lineage`**: an agent token can only list agents in its own project, so the command fails with a clear error instead of silently returning nothing. This is keyed on the credential actually in use, not on CLI mode — running inside an agent container while authenticated as a user (OAuth login, or dev auth against a localhost Hub) is not affected.

### `scion delete` (or `rm`)

Deletes an agent, removing its container, home directory, and worktree.

**Usage:** `scion delete <agent-name> [flags]`

- **Flags:**
    - `-b, --preserve-branch`: Preserve the git branch associated with the worktree (default: deleted).
    - `--stopped`: Delete all agents with stopped containers.

### `scion sync`

Synchronizes the agent workspace between the host and the container.

**Usage:** `scion sync [to|from] <agent-name> [flags]`

- **Flags:**
    - `--dry-run`: Preview changes without syncing.
    - `--exclude <glob>`: Exclude files matching the pattern.

### `scion reset-auth`

Injects a fresh Hub token into a **running** agent's container and signals it to reload, without
restarting the agent. Use this to recover an agent whose token expired and cannot self-refresh
(e.g. after a Hub signing-key rotation). Requires a Hub connection. The same action is available
as a **Reset Auth** button in the web UI. The token is passed to the container over stdin, not on the
command line, so it does not appear in the host's process list.

**Usage:** `scion reset-auth <agent-name>`

### `scion reincarnate`

Migrates an agent to a fresh **generation**: it stops the agent, re-resolves its configuration
against the current template and harness-config catalog (template, image, harness config, model,
env keys), and starts it again with the **same** agent ID and slug. The new generation's first task
is a Hub-built preamble plus the handoff you provide. Requires a Hub connection.

The Hub accepts the request with `202 Accepted` and completes the migration in the background. If
the new generation cannot be provisioned, the Hub restores the previous generation's configuration.

While the migration is in progress, messages to the agent are saved to its history rather than
delivered or dropped (the send returns `202` with status `deferred`); scheduled messages fail
instead. The new generation's preamble tells it to catch up with `scion conversation catch-up`.

Run it with no argument inside an agent container to migrate the agent itself (self-migration).
Self-migration requires `--handoff-file`, because there is no one else to describe the work in
progress. When migrating another agent, the handoff is optional.

Reincarnation works for agents in clone-per-agent, shared-workspace (shared-plain), and
Hub-managed workspaces. For a shared-workspace agent, the agent record, identity, and shared
checkout are preserved, and sibling agents sharing the checkout are not restarted. Agents in
worktree-per-agent projects are not yet supported; the Hub rejects the request with
`400 Bad Request`. Reincarnating another agent requires the `agent.lifecycle` permission (the same
as stop, start, and restart); an agent can always reincarnate itself.

**Usage:** `scion reincarnate [agent-name] [flags]`

- **Flags:**
    - `--handoff-file <path>`: File whose content becomes the new generation's first task. Required for self-migration.
    - `--dry-run`: Print the resolved plan (old → new template, image, harness config, model, env key names, and branch) without migrating anything.

:::note[Phase 1]
This release supports only `--handoff-file` and `--dry-run`. Overrides such as a different image,
model, or harness config are not yet available.

## Configuration & Workspace

### `scion project`

Manages the Scion workspace (Project).

- `scion project init`: Initialize a new project. By default, creates a `.scion` directory in the current directory or the root of the current git repository.
    - Flags:
        - `--global`: Initialize the global project in the home directory.
        - `--machine`: Perform full machine-level setup (seeds harness-configs, templates, settings).
        - `--image-registry <string>`: Configure the container image registry path (e.g., `ghcr.io/myorg`).
    - **Note:** If you are in a git repository, add `.scion/agents` to your `.gitignore` to avoid issues with nested git worktrees: `echo ".scion/agents" >> .gitignore`
    - **Hub Integration:** If a Hub endpoint is configured, `init` will prompt to register the new project with the Hub.
- `scion project list` (alias `ls`): List all projects known to Scion on this machine, including their type, agent count, status, and workspace path.
- `scion project prune`: Detect and remove project configurations whose workspace directories no longer exist. This stops any running containers associated with orphaned projects before cleaning up.
- `scion project status [project]` (alias `health`): Show agent status for a project from the Hub: counts per lifecycle phase and per activity, a per-agent table (template, harness, phase, activity), and troubleshooting hints for blocked, stalled, or errored agents. Uses the current project when no name is given.
    - Flags: `--all` (report across all projects on the Hub), `--json` (JSON output).
- `scion project service-accounts` (alias `sa`): Manage GCP service accounts registered for the project.
    - `add <email>`: Register an existing GCP service account.
        - Flags: `--gcp-project <id>` (required, the GCP project ID), `--name <string>` (display name).
    - `mint`: Create a new service account in the Hub's GCP project (the account ID is prefixed with `scion-`). Flags: `--account-id`, `--name`.
    - `list` (alias `ls`): List registered service accounts. Flags: `--json`.
    - `verify <id>`: Verify that the Hub can impersonate the service account.
    - `remove <id>` (aliases `rm`, `delete`): Remove a service account registration.
- `scion project reconnect <new-workspace-path>`: Reconnect a moved workspace to its externalized project configuration. This fixes projects that show as "orphaned" after being relocated.
- `scion project skills`: Manage auto-injected skills for the project.
    - `list [project]` (alias `ls`): List auto-injected skills configured for the current project (or a specified project).
    - `add [project] <uri>`: Add a skill URI to the project's auto-injected list.
        - Flags: `--as <alias>` (alias under which to mount the skill), `--optional` (continue provisioning if resolution fails), `--from-directory <url>` (discover and batch-add all skills from a GitHub repository directory).
    - `remove [project] <id|uri>` (aliases `rm`, `delete`): Remove an auto-injected skill entry from the project by its ID or full URI.
- `scion project hook` (alias `psh`): Manage project-scoped pre-start hooks. These shell scripts run inside the container during agent initialization, and abort agent startup on failure.
    - `list [project]` (alias `ls`): List pre-start hooks for a project.
    - `show <id-or-slug> [project]`: Show details and script content of a pre-start hook.
    - `create [project]`: Create a new hook (archives the current active hook).
        - Flags: `--name` (required, human-readable name), `--script` (required, path to shell script, or `-` for stdin), `--slug` (url-safe identifier), `--description` (optional description).
    - `update <id-or-slug> [project]`: Update an existing pre-start hook.
        - Flags: `--name`, `--script`, `--description`.
    - `activate <id-or-slug> [project]`: Mark an archived hook as active (archives any currently active hook).
    - `delete <id-or-slug> [project]` (alias `rm`, `remove`): Delete an archived hook. Active hooks cannot be deleted.
- `scion project messaging`: Manage cross-project messaging policy for a project.
    - `set [project]`: Set the inbound messaging policy.
        - Flags: `--policy <string>` (one of `none`, `members`, `all`), `--revision <int>` (required, optimistic concurrency revision).
    - `get [project]`: Show the current messaging policy and revision.

### `scion user`

Manages per-user Hub settings.

- `scion user skills`: Manage auto-injected skills for your user across all projects.
    - `list` (alias `ls`): List your personal auto-injected skills.
    - `add <uri>`: Add a skill URI to your personal auto-injected list.
        - Flags: `--as <alias>` (alias under which to mount the skill), `--optional` (continue provisioning if resolution fails), `--from-directory <url>` (discover and batch-add all skills from a GitHub repository directory).
    - `remove <id|uri>` (aliases `rm`, `delete`): Remove an auto-injected skill entry from your personal list by its ID or full URI.

### `scion secret`

Manages project-scoped secrets from the host or within an agent container. This command mirrors the `sciontool secret` commands used in agent containers, using the `hubclient` Secrets service to operate on the active project.

Unlike `scion hub secret` (which supports managing secrets at any scope: user, hub, project, or broker), `scion secret` is streamlined for project-level secrets within your current project context.

- `scion secret set KEY VALUE`: Store a project-scoped secret in the Hub.
    - If `VALUE` starts with `@`, the remainder is treated as a file path. The file contents are read and base64-encoded, and `--type` defaults to `file`.
    - Flags:
        - `--type <string>`: Secret type: `environment` (default), `variable`, or `file`.
        - `--target <string>`: Injection target path (defaults to key for env, required for file-type secrets).
        - `--allow-progeny`: Allow child agents (progeny) to inherit this secret.
- `scion secret get KEY`: Retrieve the metadata of a project-scoped secret. Secret values are never returned to protect security.
- `scion secret list`: List metadata (key, type, version, updated time) for all project-scoped secrets. Secret values are never returned.

### `scion clean`

Removes the scion project configuration from the current project or global location.

**Usage:** `scion clean [flags]`

- **Flags:**
    - `--skip-hub-check`: Skip Hub connectivity check before removing.

### `scion config`

View and modify configuration settings.

- `list`: List all effective settings.
- `get <key>`: Get a specific configuration value.
- `set <key> <value>`: Set a configuration value.

            - `--purpose <text>`: Optional bounded description of what the token is for (≤128 bytes, single line, no control characters). Immutable after issuance — there is no update command.
            - `--label <key=value>`: Optional bounded label (repeatable). Keys are lowercase `[a-z][a-z0-9_.-]*` (≤32 bytes); values are ≤64 bytes from a restricted charset. A set of attribution-shaped keys (e.g. `user_id`, `agent`, `actor_binding`) are reserved and rejected. Immutable after issuance.

## Infrastructure

### `scion runtime-broker`

Manages the local host as a Runtime Broker. The old name `scion broker` still works as a deprecated alias.

- `scion runtime-broker status`: Show status of the local broker server, including the projects it provides for. Providers added with `--auto-provide` are listed right away.
- `scion runtime-broker start`: Start the broker server as a background daemon.
    - `--foreground`: Run in the current process instead of daemonizing. Use this as the `ExecStart` of a systemd `Type=simple` unit.
    - `--port <port>`: Listen on a custom port.
    - `--auto-provide`: Automatically add this broker as a provider for new projects.
- `scion runtime-broker stop`: Stop the broker daemon.
- `scion runtime-broker register`: Register this host as a Runtime Broker with the Hub. Requires the `broker.create` permission (see [Broker Registration Permission](/scion/hosted/ha/runtime-broker/#broker-registration-permission)).
- `scion runtime-broker deregister`: Remove this broker's registration from the Hub.
- `scion runtime-broker provide`: Add this broker as a provider for a project.
- `scion runtime-broker withdraw`: Remove this broker as a provider from a project.

### `scion server`

Manages Scion server components (Hub and Broker).

- `scion server start`: Start one or more server components.
    - Flags:
        - `--enable-hub`: Enable the Hub server component.
        - `--enable-runtime-broker`: Enable the Runtime Broker component.
        - `--port <int>`: Port to listen on.
        - `--db <string>`: Database driver/connection.
        - `--dev-auth`: Enable dev-auth authentication.
        - `--admin-emails <emails>`: Email addresses to auto-promote to the administrator role. This flag is **repeatable** and also accepts a **comma-separated list** (e.g. `--admin-emails admin1@example.com,admin2@example.com --admin-emails admin3@example.com`). Strict empty-value validation is enforced.
- `scion server backfill`: Scan historical messages that predate the conversation model and assign them to conversations based on their thread, sender, and recipient metadata.
    - **Safety Default (Dry-Run):** By default, the command runs in DRY-RUN mode — scanning and reporting what would change without modifying the database. You must explicitly pass `--execute` to apply changes.
    - **Idempotency:** The backfill is idempotent: messages already attributed to a conversation are skipped, making re-running entirely safe.
    - **Compound-Cursor Resumability (DEF-81):** Supports resuming interrupted runs via `--checkpoint`. The resume checkpoint uses a compound `(created, id)` keyset cursor (instead of a strictly-greater-than timestamp) to guarantee zero permanent row loss on resume, even for messages with identical timestamps.
    - Flags:
        - `--execute`: Apply changes (default: dry-run, safe).
        - `--project <string>`: Scope backfill to a specific project ID (default: all).
        - `--batch-size <int>`: Number of messages to process per batch (default: 100).
        - `--checkpoint <string>`: Resume from this pagination cursor (project-scoped).
        - `--db <string>`: Database DSN (overrides configuration/environment DSN).

## Administration

### `scion admin`

Administrative operations for emergency recovery scenarios. These commands connect directly to the database, bypassing the running server. They are intended for break-glass situations where normal admin access has been lost.

### `scion admin promote`

Promotes an existing user to the admin role by connecting directly to the database, bypassing the running Hub server. This is a break-glass recovery command for situations where all admin users have been removed or an organization has lost admin access.

The target user must already exist in the database — this command does not create new users.

**Usage:** `scion admin promote [flags]`

- **Flags:**
    - `--email <string>`: Email address of the user to promote (required).
    - `--db <string>`: Database URL or path (overrides the config-derived connection). Accepts Postgres connection strings (`postgres://...`) or SQLite file paths.
    - `--config <string>`: Path to server configuration file (defaults to the standard `settings.yaml` resolution).

**Examples:**

```bash
# Promote using the default config-derived database connection
scion admin promote --email user@example.com

# Promote with an explicit Postgres database URL
scion admin promote --email user@example.com --db postgres://user:pass@host:5432/db

# Promote using a specific config file
scion admin promote --email user@example.com --config /path/to/server.yaml
```

:::caution[Break-glass only]
This command modifies the database directly. Use it only when normal admin access through the Hub API or Web Dashboard is unavailable. Under normal operation, manage admin roles via the Web Dashboard Users list or the `admin_emails` server setting.
:::

## Miscellaneous

### `scion doctor`

Runs host-side diagnostics: checks Git, tmux, the active container runtime, and runtime-specific
health (Docker/Podman daemon, or Kubernetes cluster/namespace/RBAC/CSI access). Supports
`--format json`.

**Usage:** `scion doctor [flags]`

:::note[In-container diagnostics]
A separate **`sciontool doctor`** command runs *inside* an agent container and diagnoses the
agent's own health — environment variables, Hub token (presence/format/expiry), Hub reachability,
token validity (a read-only check that does not refresh or revoke the token), the GCP metadata server, and the GitHub App token. See
[Harness Authentication](/scion/local/agent-credentials/#diagnostics).
:::

### `scion whoami`

Prints identity details of the current agent container or system user.

- **Outside an agent container**: Gracefully falls back to the system `whoami` command (e.g., printing the current operating system user).
- **Inside an agent container**: Prints the agent's identity. By default, it prints the agent's slug in plain text.

**Usage:** `scion whoami [flags]`

- **Flags:**
    - `--full`: Enriches the output with live metadata from the Hub. 
        - When run in plain text, prints a human-readable multi-line summary of both local environment settings and live Hub details (e.g., agent phase, activity, etc.).
        - When run with `--format json`, includes both Tier 1 and Tier 2 fields in the JSON object.
        - If the Hub is unreachable, the command gracefully degrades to returning environment-only details, printing a warning to `stderr`.
    - `--format json` (persistent global flag): Returns a structured JSON output representing the agent's identity configuration and state.

#### Output Details (`--format json`)

The command populates a structured JSON schema divided into two latency tiers:

##### Tier 1 (Always populated, zero latency, derived from container environment variables)
- `slug`: The agent's slug identifier (falls back to its name if slug is absent).
- `name`: The agent's display name.
- `id`: The unique agent UUID.
- `project` / `projectId`: The assigned project's name and ID.
- `template`: The name of the template used to spawn the agent.
- `harness`: The underlying agent harness (e.g., `codex`, etc.).
- `model`: The model used by the agent.
- `creator`: The identity of the agent's creator.
- `brokerName` / `brokerId`: The running broker's name and ID.
- `cliMode`: The active CLI mode.
- `hubEndpoint`: The endpoint URL of the connecting Hub.
- `hubUrl`: The reconstructed direct URL pointing to the agent's resource page on the Hub (`{hubEndpoint}/agents/{id}`).

##### Tier 2 (Enriched, requires `--full` flag and Hub connectivity)
- `phase`: The current lifecycle phase of the agent (e.g., `running`, `suspended`, `error`).
- `activity`: The current runtime activity status of the agent (e.g., `thinking`, `stalled`, `offline`).
- `labels`: Metadata key-value pairs assigned to the agent.
- `annotations`: System key-value pairs attached to the agent.
- `ancestry`: A lineage array representing the agent's parent/child spawn relationships.
- `taskSummary`: A brief summary of active task execution.

### `scion version`

Prints the Scion version information and optionally checks for available updates.

**Usage:** `scion version [flags]`

- **Flags:**
    - `--check`: Query the release manifest (`LATEST.json`) for available updates across release channels (stable, preview, nightly). Outputs update availability in plain text by default, or structured JSON when combined with `--format json`.
