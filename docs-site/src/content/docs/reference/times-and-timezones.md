title: Times and Timezones
description: How Scion stores, sends and shows times, and where an agent container's TZ comes from.
---

Scion keeps two kinds of time zone apart:

- **Display zone.** The zone a person sees times in, in the web dashboard or the CLI. It changes only how a time is shown.
- **Agent `TZ`.** The `TZ` environment variable of an agent container. It is infrastructure: it changes what the agent's own clock and tools report.

Neither one changes how times are stored or sent. Stored and transmitted times are always UTC.

## API contract: UTC with `Z`

Every timestamp the Hub returns, over REST, SSE and the Hub↔broker wire, is an RFC 3339 instant in UTC with a `Z` suffix, for example `2026-10-04T17:30:00Z`. This holds regardless of the timezone the Hub host runs in.

- **Inputs** may carry any offset (for example a schedule `fireAt` of `2026-10-05T09:00:00+02:00`). The Hub stores the instant and returns it in UTC.
- **Zones** are never baked into a timestamp. Where a zone matters, it travels as a separate IANA name field, such as the user preference `timezone` or the agent field `explicitTimezone`.
- **Clients** convert to a display zone at the edge.

## Display zone

### Web dashboard

Each user picks a zone with the **Display timezone** card on the profile settings page (see [Web Dashboard](/scion/workstation/dashboard/#display-timezone--clock)).

- **Auto**, the default, follows the browser's zone.
- The value is stored as the `timezone` user preference, an IANA name; empty means Auto. `PATCH /api/v1/users/:id` with an invalid name returns `400` (see the [Users API](/scion/reference/api/)).
- The display zone never changes an agent's `TZ`.

### Metrics dashboard day buckets

The metrics dashboard groups daily figures (daily sessions, active agents per day, and API calls and tokens per day) by calendar day in your display zone. The Hub computes the buckets, so the page sends the zone along with each request.

- The page sends your display zone as the `tz` query parameter, for example `GET /api/v1/metrics/?view=sessions&period=7&tz=America/Chicago`. That is your **Display timezone** preference, or your browser's zone when it is set to **Auto**.
- The Hub resolves `tz` with the IANA zone database. If `tz` is missing, is `Local`, is not an IANA zone name, or is any other value it cannot resolve, the Hub uses UTC. A bad `tz` never fails the request.
- Every view's response includes the zone the Hub used, as `timeZone`. Chart headings and the x-axis title show that zone, for example `Daily Sessions (America/Chicago)` and `Day (America/Chicago)`, or `(UTC)` for UTC.
- A day is a calendar day in that zone. Days when daylight saving time starts or ends are 23 or 25 hours long, and zones with a fractional offset (for example `Asia/Kathmandu`, +05:45) are handled the same way as any other.
- "Last N days" means the last N calendar days in that zone, today included. The window starts at local midnight N−1 days ago, and the summary totals use the same window.
- Changing your display zone reloads the dashboard in the new zone.

### CLI

The CLI shows times in the local zone of the machine it runs on. Inside an agent container, that is the agent's `TZ`. Two global flags override it:

| Flag | Effect |
| :--- | :--- |
| `--tz <zone>` | Show times in this IANA zone, for example `--tz America/New_York`. |
| `--utc` | Show times in UTC. |

- The two flags are mutually exclusive.
- `--tz Local` and names that are not IANA zones are rejected.
- JSON output (`--format json`) is unchanged by either flag; it always carries UTC `Z` timestamps.
- There is no environment-variable override. The CLI does not read the Hub display preference.

### 24-hour clock

The web dashboard shows clock times in 24-hour form (`00:05`, not `12:05 AM`), with a fixed English format locale. There is no 12-hour or locale setting.

## Agent `TZ` (Hub-dispatched agents)

For an agent dispatched by a Hub, the Hub is the only source of `TZ`. On create, start and restart it sends the first value set in this chain:

| Step | Source | `timezoneSource` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | The agent's pinned timezone (see [Pin and unpin](#pin-and-unpin)). | `explicit`, or `legacy` for a pin adopted from a `TZ` an older Hub saved in the agent's env |
| 2 | A `TZ` variable in the Hub environment-variable store with injection mode `always`, at user, project, hub or broker scope. The first scope in that order wins. An empty value never wins. | `user`, `project`, `hub`, `broker` |
| 3 | An ancestor agent's user-scope `TZ` variable shared with progeny. | `progeny` |
| 4 | The Hub default timezone, `agent_defaults.default_timezone`. | `hub-default` |
| 5 | Nothing. No `TZ` is sent, and the container uses the image default (UTC). | `none` |

### Hub default timezone

Admins set it in the web dashboard under **Admin → Server Config**, in the **Agent Defaults** card (field **Default Timezone**), or through `PUT /api/v1/admin/server-config` with the top-level field `default_timezone` (stored as the Layer-1 key `agent_defaults.default_timezone`).

- An invalid name, or `Local`, is rejected with `422`.
- Empty means no Hub default.
- In `settings.yaml` it is the top-level `default_timezone` key.

See [Operational settings](/scion/reference/server-config/#layer-1--operational-hub_settings-table) and [Admin settings](/scion/reference/admin-settings/).

To give every agent on one Runtime Broker a zone, set a broker-scope `TZ` variable on the Hub:

```bash
scion hub env set --broker=<broker> --always TZ Europe/Berlin
```

### What does not set `TZ`

- **Runtime profiles.** There is no profile step. A `TZ` in a profile's `harness_overrides` env is not used, and profiles have no `env` key. See [Removed: profile `timezone`](/scion/reference/orchestrator-settings/#removed-profile-timezone).
- **Broker-local values.** The Runtime Broker ignores `TZ` from:
  - broker-local templates;
  - the broker settings' harness-config entry `env`;
  - the agent's persisted `scion-agent.json`.

  It logs a warning, and adds a start warning, for each non-empty value it drops that differs from the value the Hub sent. An empty `TZ: ""` marker never passes the broker host's `TZ` through.
- **`config.env` on update.** A `TZ` key in `config.env` on an agent `PATCH` is ignored with the warning `TZ in config.env is ignored; use explicitTimezone`.
- **Secrets.** A secret that targets `TZ` is dropped with a warning.

### Pin and unpin

A pin is the agent's explicit timezone. It is set in three ways:

- **At create.** A `TZ` value in the create request's `config.env`, in a Hub-resolved template, or in the Hub harness config becomes the pin.
- **Later, by API.** `PATCH /api/v1/agents/:id` with `explicitTimezone`:
  - an IANA name pins the agent; an invalid name, or `Local`, returns `400`;
  - `""` unpins it, and the agent follows steps 2-5 from then on.

  The field is accepted in any phase except on a deleted agent (`409`). A running container keeps its `TZ` until the next start, and the response warns `explicitTimezone applies at the agent's next start`. The response also carries `resolvedTimezone` (the `TZ` the next start sends, `""` when none) and `timezoneSource` (the step in the table above). See the [Agents API](/scion/reference/api/).
- **Later, in the web dashboard.** The agent's **Configure** page has a **Timezone** row. It shows the resolved zone and its source, and offers **Pin** and **Unpin**.

An agent created by an older Hub may have a `TZ` saved in its applied config env. The Hub converts that value to a pin (source `legacy`) the first time it reads the agent's timezone. The `applied-config-tz-cleanup` operation does the same for every agent in one pass (see [Operator steps](#operator-steps)).

### Reincarnate

`scion reincarnate` keeps the agent's timezone choice:

- a pin, including a `legacy` pin, is carried to the new agent;
- an unpin is carried too, so a create-time `TZ` does not come back;
- an agent with neither re-derives its pin from its original create inputs and the current template.

## Cron schedules are UTC only

Recurring schedules are evaluated in UTC, and there is no schedule timezone setting.

- An expression that starts with `CRON_TZ=` or `TZ=` is rejected with `400`.
- Schedules saved with such a prefix by an older Hub are paused at Hub start, with one warning per schedule in the Hub log. To resume one, edit its expression to UTC first.

See [Scheduling](/scion/hosted/user/scheduling/#recurring-schedules).

## Local mode

Without a Hub there is no `TZ` chain, no Hub default timezone and no display preference.

- **Agent `TZ`** comes only from the `env` you give the agent:
  - a template's `env`;
  - the harness-config `env` in `settings.yaml`, including a profile's `harness_overrides` entry for that harness config;
  - an inline config passed with `scion create --config`.

  An empty `TZ: ""` in a template or an inline config passes your machine's `TZ` through. A `TZ` in a `settings.yaml` harness-config entry (or a profile's `harness_overrides`) takes precedence over a template or inline-config `TZ`. If it is empty, `TZ` is omitted with a warning, even when a template or inline config sets one, and the container uses the image default (UTC). With no `TZ` in any of them, the container uses the image default (UTC).
- **CLI display** uses your local zone, with `--tz` and `--utc` as above.

A Hub-created agent that is later started with a local `scion start` uses the `TZ` saved in its `scion-agent.json` again.

## Operator steps

Two maintenance migrations relate to times. An admin runs them from **Admin → Maintenance** in the web dashboard, which offers a dry run, or with `POST /api/v1/admin/maintenance/migrations/<key>/run`. Nothing runs them automatically.

| Key | What it does | When to run it |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `utc-timestamp-normalize` | Rewrites stored timestamps to canonical UTC, so that ordering and paging are exact. On SQLite it covers every table time column and the times inside JSON fields; on Postgres, the times inside JSON fields. On SQLite, rows that the database driver cannot read are also repaired automatically, at Hub start, after a database snapshot. Such rows come from a Hub running in a zone that has no letter abbreviation and an offset that is not a whole hour (for example `Asia/Kathmandu`). For such a zone Go prints the four-digit numeric offset in place of the abbreviation, so the stored value contains `+0545 +0545`. | Once after upgrading, after a backup. On SQLite, the Hub logs at start which tables still need it; Postgres has no startup check, so run it once after upgrading. Safe to re-run, and it can run again after it completes. |
| `applied-config-tz-cleanup` | Converts `TZ` values that older Hubs saved in agents' applied config env into `legacy` pins, in one pass, and reports how many agents it converted. | Optional, because the Hub already converts each agent lazily. Run it **before** `applied-config-env-cleanup` to keep every saved `TZ` as a pin; if the env cleanup runs first, saved values with no live source are removed and those agents follow the chain instead. Safe to re-run, and it can run again after it completes; a second run converts 0. |

The Maintenance page offers **Run** for a pending migration and **Retry** for a failed one, and no button once a migration has completed. To re-run one of these after it has completed, use `POST /api/v1/admin/maintenance/migrations/<key>/run`.
