# scion-a2a-bridge

A protocol bridge that exposes Scion agents as [A2A (Agent-to-Agent)](https://google.github.io/A2A/) endpoints, allowing any A2A-compatible client to discover and interact with agents managed by a Scion Hub.

## What it does

- Translates A2A JSON-RPC requests into Scion Hub API calls and vice versa.
- Generates A2A Agent Cards for each exposed agent, enriched with metadata from the Hub.
- Supports blocking request/response, SSE streaming, and push notification (webhook) delivery modes.
- Manages task lifecycle state in a local SQLite database (plugin mode) or shared PostgreSQL database (standalone mode).
- In standalone mode, SDK task payloads are durably stored in PostgreSQL (`a2a_sdk_tasks` table) with transactional ownership enforcement and CAS/version semantics, enabling cross-replica access, restart recovery, and horizontal scaling.
- Connects to the Hub via a broker plugin (go-plugin RPC) or standalone gRPC broker to receive agent messages in real time.

## Configuration

Copy and edit the sample configuration file:

```sh
cp scion-a2a-bridge.yaml.sample scion-a2a-bridge.yaml
```

Key sections:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `bridge` | A2A HTTP server address, external URL, provider metadata |
| `hub` | Scion Hub endpoint, admin user, signing key (file path or GCP Secret Manager) |
| `plugin` | Broker plugin RPC listen address (default `localhost:9090`) |
| `auth` | Client authentication — API key or bearer token |
| `projects` | Which projects and agents to expose, with optional auto-provisioning |
| `state` | SQLite database path |
| `timeouts` | Send message timeout, SSE keepalive interval, push retry limit |
| `rate_limit` | Per-key token-bucket rate limiting |
| `logging` | Log level and format (text or JSON) |

Environment variables can be referenced as `${VAR_NAME}` in the YAML file. **Note:** `os.Expand` has no escape mechanism — a literal `$` in config values (e.g. in an API key like `Pa$$w0rd`) will be interpreted as the start of an environment variable reference. Avoid literal `$` in non-variable config values, or set such values via environment variables instead.

## Running

### Locally

```sh
go build -o scion-a2a-bridge ./cmd/scion-a2a-bridge/
./scion-a2a-bridge --config scion-a2a-bridge.yaml
```

### Docker

```sh
docker build -t scion-a2a-bridge -f Dockerfile ../..
docker run -p 8443:8443 -p 9090:9090 \
  -v /path/to/config.yaml:/etc/scion-a2a-bridge/config.yaml \
  scion-a2a-bridge
```

## Key endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/.well-known/agent-card.json` | GET | Bridge registry card |
| `/projects/{project}/agents/{agent}/.well-known/agent-card.json` | GET | Per-agent A2A card |
| `/projects/{project}/agents/{agent}/jsonrpc` | POST | A2A JSON-RPC endpoint |
| `/healthz` | GET | Liveness check |
| `/readyz` | GET | Readiness check (database, broker) |
| `/metrics` | GET | Prometheus metrics (restrict access — see Security) |

### Supported JSON-RPC methods

- `message/send` — send a message (blocking or non-blocking)
- `message/stream` — send a message with SSE streaming response
- `tasks/get` — retrieve task status by ID
- `tasks/list` — list tasks by context ID
- `tasks/cancel` — cancel an in-progress task
- `tasks/resubscribe` — re-attach an SSE stream to an active task
- `tasks/pushNotification/set` — register a webhook for task updates
- `tasks/pushNotification/get` — list webhooks for a task
- `tasks/pushNotification/delete` — remove a webhook

## TLS

The A2A server listens on plain HTTP. **TLS must be terminated at a reverse proxy** (e.g. Caddy, nginx, or a cloud load balancer) in front of the bridge. The bridge logs a `WARN` at startup as a reminder. Do not expose the bridge port directly to the internet without a TLS-terminating proxy.

## Ports

| Port | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| 8443 | A2A HTTP server (JSON-RPC, agent cards, health/metrics) |
| 9090 | Broker plugin RPC (Hub connects here to push agent messages) |

## Admin UI management

The A2A bridge can be installed, configured, and monitored from the Scion Hub admin UI. This is the recommended approach for most deployments.

### Installation via admin UI

1. Navigate to **Admin > Integrations** in the Scion web UI.
2. The A2A Bridge appears under **Available Integrations** (listed as "External service — installed separately, managed via admin UI").
3. Click **Install** for the A2A Bridge entry.
4. The Hub creates configuration files and registers the bridge in `settings.yaml`. The UI displays setup instructions including the binary name, config file path, and a sample start command.
5. Build the bridge binary (see [Build the binary](#2-build-the-binary) below, or use `make build-a2a-bridge` from the repository root).
6. Start the bridge process using the displayed command (e.g., `scion-a2a-bridge -config ~/.scion/scion-a2a-bridge.yaml`).
7. Return to the admin UI and click **Reconnect** to activate the integration. The status changes to **Connected** once the Hub reaches the bridge's RPC endpoint.

### Configuration via admin UI

Once installed, the bridge's admin-managed settings can be edited from the integration detail page:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Auth scheme** | Client authentication mode: `apiKey`, `bearer`, `none`, `hubUAT`, or `hubJWT`. Select from the dropdown. |
| **API key** | Static API key for `apiKey`/`bearer` schemes. Stored in the Hub secret backend — never written to YAML files. Only shown when the auth scheme requires it. |
| **External URL** | Public URL where A2A clients reach the bridge (e.g., `https://a2a.example.com`). Used in generated agent cards. |
| **Rate limiting** | Enable/disable per-client rate limiting, with configurable requests-per-second and burst size. |
| **Provider metadata** | Organization name and URL included in agent cards. |
| **Timeouts** | Send-message timeout, SSE keepalive interval, and push notification retry limit. |

Changes saved via the admin UI take effect immediately on the running bridge — no bridge restart is required. The Hub pushes the updated configuration over the existing RPC connection.

### Project and agent exposure

The admin UI provides a structured editor for controlling which projects and agents are reachable via A2A:

- **Add projects**: Select a project from the dropdown to expose it over A2A.
- **Restrict agents**: Optionally select specific agents within a project. Leave empty to expose all agents in the project.
- **Auto-provision**: Toggle whether the bridge automatically provisions conversations for new A2A tasks.
- **Default template**: Set the default agent template used when auto-provisioning.

Changes to project/agent exposure take effect immediately without a bridge restart.

### Operational notes

- **Config changes are live.** Admin UI settings are pushed to the running bridge via RPC. No bridge restart is needed for admin-managed settings.
- **Bootstrap settings remain operator-managed.** Listen addresses (`bridge.listen_address`, `plugin.listen_address`), TLS configuration, state database path, and the Hub signing key are configured in the bridge's own YAML file (`scion-a2a-bridge.yaml`). These are displayed as read-only in the admin UI.
- **Config persistence.** The bridge persists admin overlay settings to `admin-overlay.json` in the state directory. This overlay survives bridge restarts — settings configured via the admin UI are re-applied at boot before the bridge begins serving.
- **Version skew.** An older bridge binary with a newer Hub ignores the `Configure()` push (existing no-op behavior). A newer bridge with an older Hub simply never receives admin overlay pushes. Neither direction breaks messaging. The admin UI displays the bridge version so operators can identify pre-admin-support binaries.
- **Dev-mode rebuild.** When the Hub is running with `MaintenanceConfig.RepoPath` set (development mode), the Update action rebuilds the bridge binary from source. The response instructs the operator to restart the bridge process manually — the Hub does not manage the bridge lifecycle.

## Setup and onboarding (agent instructions)

Step-by-step instructions for installing, configuring, and running the A2A bridge from scratch. Every command is copy-paste ready.

### 1. Prerequisites

1. Install Go 1.25 or later. Confirm with `go version`.
2. Have network access to a running Scion Hub instance. Note its HTTP API URL (e.g., `https://hub.example.com`).
3. Obtain the Hub's HS256 signing key, base64-encoded. This is either:
   - A file on disk containing the raw base64 string, or
   - A GCP Secret Manager resource name (e.g., `projects/my-project/secrets/hub-signing-key`).
4. Have a Hub admin user email that the bridge will authenticate as (e.g., `a2a-bridge@example.com`).
5. Know the project slug(s) you want to expose over A2A.

### 2. Build the binary

From the repository root:

```sh
cd extras/scion-a2a-bridge
go build -o scion-a2a-bridge ./cmd/scion-a2a-bridge/
```

Verify the binary exists:

```sh
ls -l scion-a2a-bridge
```

### 3. Create and edit the config file

Copy the sample config:

```sh
cp scion-a2a-bridge.yaml.sample scion-a2a-bridge.yaml
```

Edit `scion-a2a-bridge.yaml`. The required fields are:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `hub.endpoint` | Hub HTTP API URL | `https://hub.example.com` |
| `hub.user` | Admin identity the bridge uses for Hub API calls | `a2a-bridge@example.com` |
| `hub.signing_key` | Path to a file containing the Hub's base64-encoded HS256 signing key. Mutually exclusive with `hub.signing_key_secret`. | `/path/to/signing-key.b64` |
| `hub.signing_key_secret` | GCP Secret Manager resource name for the signing key. Mutually exclusive with `hub.signing_key`. | `projects/my-project/secrets/hub-signing-key` |
| `bridge.listen_address` | Address for the A2A HTTP server | `:8443` |
| `bridge.external_url` | Public URL where A2A clients reach the bridge | `https://a2a.example.com` |
| `auth.api_key` | Static API key clients pass in the `X-API-Key` header. Supports env var expansion. | `${A2A_API_KEY}` |
| `projects[].slug` | Grove slug to expose. Add one entry per project. | `my-project` |
| `plugin.listen_address` | Broker plugin RPC listen address | `localhost:9090` |

Minimal config example:

```yaml
bridge:
  listen_address: ":8443"
  external_url: "https://a2a.example.com"
  provider:
    organization: "My Org"
    url: "https://example.com"

hub:
  endpoint: "https://hub.example.com"
  user: "a2a-bridge@example.com"
  signing_key: "/path/to/signing-key.b64"

plugin:
  listen_address: "localhost:9090"

auth:
  scheme: "apiKey"
  api_key: "${A2A_API_KEY}"

projects:
  - slug: "my-project"
    auto_provision: false

state:
  database: "/var/lib/scion-a2a-bridge/state.db"

logging:
  level: "info"
  format: "json"
```

### 4. Configure the Hub

Edit the Hub's `settings.yaml` to enable the message broker and register the bridge as a plugin.

Add or update these sections:

```yaml
message_broker:
  enabled: true

server:
  plugins:
    broker:
      a2a-bridge:
        self_managed: true
        address: "localhost:9090"
```

The `address` must match `plugin.listen_address` in the bridge config. Restart the Hub after making these changes.

### 5. Start the bridge

Set the API key environment variable (if using `${A2A_API_KEY}` in config):

```sh
export A2A_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

Start the bridge:

```sh
./scion-a2a-bridge --config scion-a2a-bridge.yaml
```

### 6. Verify it is running

Run these checks against the bridge (adjust host/port if `bridge.listen_address` differs):

```sh
# Liveness check — expect HTTP 200
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' http://localhost:8443/healthz

# Readiness check — expect HTTP 200 (database and broker connected)
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' http://localhost:8443/readyz

# Bridge registry agent card — expect JSON with A2A agent card
curl -s http://localhost:8443/.well-known/agent-card.json | head -20

# Per-agent card (replace PROJECT and AGENT with actual values)
curl -s http://localhost:8443/projects/PROJECT/agents/AGENT/.well-known/agent-card.json
```

### 7. Test with a sample JSON-RPC request

Send a `message/send` request to an agent's JSON-RPC endpoint:

```sh
curl -s -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: ${A2A_API_KEY}" \
  http://localhost:8443/projects/PROJECT/agents/AGENT/jsonrpc \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": "test-1",
    "method": "message/send",
    "params": {
      "message": {
        "role": "user",
        "parts": [
          {"kind": "text", "text": "Hello, agent."}
        ]
      }
    }
  }'
```

Replace `PROJECT` and `AGENT` with the target project slug and agent name. A successful response contains a `result` object with `id`, `status`, and `artifacts` fields.

### 8. Docker deployment

The Docker build requires `CGO_ENABLED=1` (for `go-sqlite3`). The default runtime image is `debian:bookworm-slim` (glibc). Alpine users must use a musl-compatible SQLite driver or switch to a glibc-based image.

Build the image from the repository root (the Dockerfile expects the full repo context):

```sh
docker build -t scion-a2a-bridge -f extras/scion-a2a-bridge/Dockerfile .
```

Run the container, mounting your config file:

```sh
docker run -p 8443:8443 -p 9090:9090 \
  -e A2A_API_KEY="your-api-key-here" \
  -v /path/to/scion-a2a-bridge.yaml:/etc/scion-a2a-bridge/config.yaml \
  -v /path/to/signing-key.b64:/etc/scion-a2a-bridge/signing-key.b64 \
  scion-a2a-bridge
```

The container runs as non-root user `bridge` (UID 1000). The state database directory `/var/lib/scion-a2a-bridge/` is writable by this user inside the container (mode `0700`). To persist state across restarts, mount a volume at that path.

## Standalone mode and horizontal scaling

In standalone mode (`--standalone --database-url postgresql://...`), the bridge uses a shared PostgreSQL database for both internal bridge state and SDK task payloads:

| Table | Purpose | Managed by |
|-------|---------|------------|
| `a2a_tasks` | Bridge internal state (task metadata, conversation IDs, agent correlation) | `state.PostgresStore` |
| `a2a_task_events` | Durable event log for SSE streaming and blocking-mode polling | `state.PostgresStore` |
| `a2a_sdk_tasks` | Full A2A SDK task payloads (complete `a2a.Task` JSON, ownership, versioning, execution lease) | `bridge.PostgresTaskStore` |

**Important:** These tables share the same database and a **single shared `*sql.DB` connection pool** (the SDK task store is created via `NewPostgresTaskStoreWithDB(store.DB())`). Each store issues **independent request-level transactions** — a bridge request that writes to both `a2a_tasks` and `a2a_sdk_tasks` does so in separate SQL transactions, not a single atomic operation. Retention cleanup (`PurgeTasksAndEvents`) and execution lease reaping (`ReapStaleTasks`) are exceptions — each operates within a single transaction.

### Task ownership and isolation

Each SDK task is bound to an **owner key** derived from the request's route (project + agent) and, when caller authentication is active, the caller's identity. Ownership is enforced at the SQL level on every individual operation (create, get, list, update):

- **Route isolation**: Tasks created under `project-a/agent-x` are invisible to requests targeting `project-b/agent-y`.
- **Caller isolation**: When caller authentication is configured, each user sees only their own tasks within a route.

### Concurrency and CAS semantics

Updates use a monotonically incrementing version counter with compare-and-swap (CAS) semantics. When `PrevVersion` is set, the update succeeds only if the stored version matches — otherwise `ErrConcurrentModification` is returned. This prevents lost updates when multiple replicas process concurrent requests for the same task.

### Duplicate delivery

Duplicate task creation returns `ErrTaskAlreadyExists` (unique constraint on task ID). Duplicate updates with a stale version return `ErrConcurrentModification` deterministically — no state corruption occurs. At the bridge event layer, duplicate broker messages are deduplicated by a stable `dedup_key` (derived from the upstream message ID or a deterministic content hash) via `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` on the `a2a_task_events` table.

### Cross-replica access

All replicas read from and write to the same PostgreSQL database. A task created on replica A is immediately visible to replica B via `Get` or `List`. Status updates and artifact additions performed on any replica are durable and visible to all replicas.

### Execution lease and crash recovery

Each task may have an active **execution lease** tracked by `exec_owner` (replica identifier, format `hostname:pid`) and `exec_heartbeat` (timestamp). The lifecycle is:

1. **Claim**: Before sending a message to the Hub, a replica atomically claims execution (`exec_owner = $self, exec_heartbeat = NOW()` with a conditional check that no other replica holds a fresh lease). This prevents duplicate Hub sends.
2. **Heartbeat**: During long-running execution, the replica periodically refreshes `exec_heartbeat` to keep the lease alive.
3. **Release**: On normal completion, the lease is cleared.
4. **Crash recovery**: If a replica dies mid-execution, the lease expires. A reaper on another replica detects tasks where `exec_owner IS NOT NULL AND exec_heartbeat < cutoff` and atomically transitions them to `failed` via CAS on both `version` and `exec_owner`. Only tasks with expired leases are reaped — tasks without execution claims (long-running legitimate work) are never affected.

The crash recovery transition is **deterministic**: exactly one replica wins the CAS per stale task. The failed state is persisted and visible to all replicas. The user can then safely retry by creating a new task. Hub side effects (messages already sent before the crash) are **not replayed** — the system does not claim exactly-once delivery of Hub operations.

### Restart recovery

Task state survives process restarts. A new `PostgresTaskStore` instance reconnects to the same database and finds all previously created tasks with their current versions and payloads.

### Retention cleanup

Terminal tasks (completed, failed, canceled, rejected) and their correlated bridge events are purged by `PurgeTasksAndEvents` within a **single transaction**, maintaining referential consistency between `a2a_sdk_tasks` and `a2a_task_events`. The bridge's `RunSweep` calls this periodically (default cutoff: 1 hour). The janitor also calls `ReapStaleTasks` on each tick to transition tasks with expired execution leases to `failed`.

### SSE resubscription and cursor semantics

SSE streams read from the durable `a2a_task_events` log using a monotonic cursor (the event's `BIGSERIAL` ID). Resubscription with a saved cursor resumes from that point — no prior-turn replay occurs. This works across replicas because all replicas read from the same event log.

### Limitations

- **Hub side-effect replay**: If a replica crashes after sending a message to the Hub but before recording completion, the Hub side effect is not replayed. The task transitions to `failed` via crash recovery, and the user retries manually.
- **SSE stream locality**: SSE streams are process-local. Resubscription to the same task from a different replica creates a new stream reading from the shared event log; it does not resume the previous replica's stream state.

## Known Limitations

- **No gRPC or REST transport.** The bridge only supports JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP. gRPC and HTTP+JSON/REST transports are not implemented.
- **Blocking-mode `input-required` flows.** In blocking mode, state-change messages are skipped for waiters so the actual content reply is delivered. A blocking `message/send` against an agent that transitions to `input-required` without sending content will time out (default 120s). Use non-blocking mode with push notifications or SSE for `input-required` flows.

## Security considerations

### SQLite state database

The SQLite database stores webhook bearer credentials (`token`, `auth_credentials`) in cleartext. To protect these secrets at rest:

- **File permissions**: the database file must be readable only by the bridge process (`chmod 0600`). The Dockerfile enforces `0700` on the data directory.
- **Encrypted storage**: deploy the database on an encrypted volume (e.g., LUKS, dm-crypt, cloud-provider encrypted disks) so that a disk image or backup leak does not expose webhook tokens.
- **Short-lived tokens**: use short-lived or rotatable webhook tokens where possible. Avoid long-lived static bearer tokens for push notification webhooks, since a database leak exposes every client's webhook credentials.
- **Future**: envelope encryption (AES-GCM with a config-supplied KEK) for credential columns is planned. HMAC body-signing (`X-A2A-Signature`) will replace static bearer tokens for webhook authentication, eliminating the need to store shared secrets. See `push.go` for the tracking TODO.

### Signing key

The bridge mints HS256 admin JWTs using the Hub's signing key. Anyone who reads this key (from the config file, state database, or process memory) can forge admin tokens for `hub.user`. Use a dedicated, minimally-privileged Hub user for the bridge — not a full admin account. Store the signing key via GCP Secret Manager (`hub.signing_key_secret`) rather than a plaintext file where possible.

### Broker plugin RPC (`plugin.allow_remote`)

By default the broker plugin RPC binds to loopback only. Setting `plugin.allow_remote: true` (e.g. to run the Hub and bridge in separate containers) opens the socket to the network with **no transport authentication** — anything that can dial the port can publish arbitrary messages as if they came from real agents. When using `allow_remote: true`, deploy the bridge behind a network-level mTLS boundary or firewall that restricts access to the Hub's IP only.

### `/metrics` endpoint

The `/metrics` endpoint requires the same API key authentication as other non-public endpoints. Prometheus scrapers must include the API key in their scrape configuration (e.g., via `authorization` or `headers` in the Prometheus job config). If this is undesirable, consider running a dedicated metrics listener on a separate port restricted to internal networks.

### Rate limiting and `trust_proxy`

When `rate_limit.trust_proxy: true` is set, the bridge takes the client IP from the leftmost `X-Forwarded-For` header value, which is fully attacker-controlled. Any client can rotate XFF values to bypass per-IP rate limits. Only enable `trust_proxy` when the bridge sits behind a trusted reverse proxy, and restrict network access to the bridge port so that only the proxy can reach it. A `trusted_proxies` CIDR allowlist is planned for a future release.

### Push notifications (webhooks)

Push notification URLs are validated against SSRF before use. The bridge:

- Rejects URLs that resolve to private, loopback, link-local, CGNAT, or reserved IP ranges (see `ValidatePushURL`).
- Applies a connect-time `Dialer.Control` callback (`ssrfSafeDialer`) that re-checks resolved IPs, defeating DNS rebinding attacks.
- Blocks HTTP redirects to prevent leaking `Authorization` headers to redirect targets.

Operators should additionally restrict outbound network access at the infrastructure level (e.g., firewall egress rules) as defense-in-depth.
