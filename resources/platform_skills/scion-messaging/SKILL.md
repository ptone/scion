# Scion Messaging

## Overview

In this multi-agent orchestration environment, the primary way to communicate is via the `scion message` command. This skill codifies the patterns required for reliable, high-signal communication within the Scion ecosystem.

## When to Use

- When starting a task that requires coordination with other agents.
- When you need to provide a status update or ask a question to a user.
- When forwarding feedback or unblocking another agent.
- When you need to send literal keystrokes to an agent's terminal (via `scion keys`).
- When scheduling messages for the future (via `scion schedule create`).

**When NOT to use:** For internal cognitive work or logging that doesn't need to be seen by others. Never use messaging for banter or repetitive, low-signal status updates.

## Recipient Types

Choosing the right recipient is critical to avoid spam and ensure the message reaches the intended target.

- **`@<agent-name>`**: Send a message to a specific agent (e.g., `scion message @tech-lead "..."`). This addresses the agent's conversation directly.
- **`@<email>`**: Send a global DM to a user by email address (e.g., `scion message @preston@example.com "..."`).
- **`group[a,b,...]`**: Group messaging to a specific list of recipients (Hub mode only).
- **`conv:<uuid>`**: Address a conversation by ID. **This is the preferred and
  usually correct way to reply to any message you received** — pass the
  `conversation.id` field from the inbound message envelope. Prefer this over
  addressing the sender directly (`@<email>`) when replying, especially in a
  group conversation: addressing a user directly opens (or continues) that
  user's native-surface DM conversation, a *different* conversation from the
  one the message came from. Reply with `@<email>` only when you are
  deliberately starting a new, separate DM — not when replying to something
  you were addressed in. View its details with
  `scion conversation get conv:<uuid>`; see the `scion-conversation` skill.

### Mentions

- You can alert a secondary tier participant in a conversation by using the `@<agent-name>` or `@<email>` recipient types in the body of a message. Use this for FYI informative or CC, be clear if there is a response or action expected. If there is more than one primary recipient use the `group[]` recipient type.

## Message Timing and Cadence

Effective communication requires balancing responsiveness with focus.

1.  **Immediate Acknowledgment**: Reply immediately to acknowledge receipt (e.g., "Got it, starting on the tech spec for X").
2.  **Milestone Reporting**: Report at significant milestones, not continuously. Don't spam "Still working..." messages.
3.  **No Silence**: If a task takes longer than expected, send a brief update before diving back in. Always send a final message when you are done.
4.  **Simple Questions**: Gather all necessary info first, then ask clearly. Don't send a stream of consciousness.
5.  **Status Blocked**: When waiting for a reply or a scheduled event, use `sciontool status blocked "<reason>"` to signal you are intentionally waiting.

## Message Formatting

The `scion message` CLI delivers the body argument **verbatim** — it performs no escape expansion, and no character substitution. Whatever bytes you pass are exactly what the recipient sees. Markdown is rendered in chat surfaces.

### Use structured markdown

Any message longer than a sentence or two **must** use structured markdown. Dense single paragraphs are hard to scan and act on in a chat surface.

- **Headline first**: start with a short **bold** one-line summary of the message.
- **Bullets for facts**: put status, findings and blockers in bullets, each starting with a short bold label (e.g. `**Status:**`, `**Blocker:**`, `**Found:**`, `**Cause:**`).
- **Choices are always a list**: one option per bulleted or numbered item, each with its trade-off. Mark the recommended option, or add a separate `**Recommendation:**` line. Never write options inline in a paragraph ("A) ... B) ... C) ...").
- **Ask on its own line**: end with the explicit question or decision needed, set apart from the rest (e.g. `**Ask:** ...`).
- **Code formatting**: use `code` for identifiers, commands, branch names and paths. Put a command the reader should run in its own fenced block.
- **Short paragraphs**: one idea per paragraph or bullet.

A one-line reply or acknowledgment needs no structure — "Got it, starting on #42." is fine as is.

Bad — one paragraph, options inline, the ask buried at the end:

```text
I looked into the flaky TestSync failure and it seems to be caused by the
shared temp dir between parallel subtests, which I could fix by A) giving
each subtest its own t.TempDir(), which is the cleanest but touches 12
tests, B) removing t.Parallel() from the suite, which is a one-line change
but slows CI by about 40s, or C) adding a mutex around the dir setup, which
is quick but hides the real problem. Which do you want me to do?
```

Good — the same content, structured:

```markdown
**Flaky `TestSync` traced to a shared temp dir**

- **Cause:** parallel subtests share one temp dir in `pkg/sync/sync_test.go`.
- **Status:** reproduced locally; no fix applied yet.

**Options:**
1. Give each subtest its own `t.TempDir()`. Cleanest; touches 12 tests.
2. Remove `t.Parallel()` from the suite. One-line change; CI ~40s slower.
3. Add a mutex around dir setup. Quick; hides the real problem.

**Recommendation:** option 1.

**Ask:** OK to proceed with option 1?
```

### Newlines and quoting

To include newlines, use real newlines inside shell quoted strings or heredocs. Do **not** use JSON-encoded bodies or literal backslash-n sequences — those will appear as literal characters in the delivered message.

**Backticks and `$(...)` are executed by the shell.** Inside a double-quoted argument, the shell runs anything in backticks or `$(...)` *before* `scion` starts and splices the output into the body. Markdown inline code like `` `make test` `` in a double-quoted body therefore runs `make test` and sends its output (often empty) instead of the text. `scion` cannot detect this. Whenever a body contains backticks, `$`, or code, send it through stdin or a file:

- `scion message <recipient> -` reads the body from stdin.
- `scion message <recipient> --body-file <path>` reads it from a file. `--body-file -` also reads stdin.
- For stdin and `--body-file`, trailing CR/LF characters are trimmed; everything else is sent exactly as read.

Correct — quoted heredoc on stdin (the `'EOF'` quotes stop all expansion; preferred for anything with markdown or code):
```bash
scion message --non-interactive @reviewer - <<'EOF'
PR #42 is ready for review.

Branch: fix/auth-bug
CI: all green. Run `make test` to reproduce.
EOF
```

Correct — body from a file:
```bash
scion message --non-interactive @reviewer --body-file /tmp/review-notes.md
```

Correct — plain text only (no backticks or `$`) in a double-quoted string with real newlines:
```bash
scion message --non-interactive @reviewer "PR #42 is ready for review.

Branch: fix/auth-bug
CI: all green"
```

Wrong — backticks inside double quotes (the shell runs `make test`):
```bash
# BAD: `make test` executes in your shell; its output replaces it in the body
scion message --non-interactive @reviewer "CI is green. Run `make test` to reproduce."
```

Wrong — JSON-encoded body with literal \n:
```bash
# BAD: literal \n chars appear in the delivered message
scion message --non-interactive @reviewer "PR #42 is ready for review.\n\nBranch: fix/auth-bug\nCI: all green"
```

## Message Content Best Practices

Every message should move work forward. High-signal messages are functional and concrete.

- **Be Functional**: No banter, cheerleading, or "Ready to help!" filler.
- **Keep tone conversational and short.** Messages should be functional but not robotic — write like a colleague. Conversational wording still goes inside the structured layout above.
- **You are identified as a sender** — the system already shows your identity with every message. Don't open with "Hi, this is agent-X" or restate who you are.
- **Include Concrete Details**: Reference file paths, branch names, URLs, and specific error messages.
- **Surface Decisions**: When asking a sender for input, provide 2-3 concrete options as a list, state your recommendation, and include the timing impact of each. See [Use structured markdown](#use-structured-markdown).
- **Keep it Concise**: Focus on key findings and links rather than lengthy narratives.
- **Confirm receipt, then report completion.** When you receive a task, respond immediately to confirm you got it. Then report again when the work is done. Don't leave a sender wondering whether their message was received.


## Special Message Flags

The `scion message` command provides the following flags:

- **`--wake`**: Resumes a suspended agent before delivering the message.
- **`--interrupt`**: Interrupts the target agent's harness before sending the message (use with caution).
- **`--attach <file>`**: Attaches one or more file paths to the message. Repeatable.
- **`--body-file <path>`**: Reads the message body from a file instead of a positional argument (`--body-file -` reads stdin). A positional body of `-` also reads stdin.
**Capabilities that exist as separate commands:**
- **Literal keystrokes**: Use `scion keys <agent> <keys>` to send input to an agent's tmux terminal, with no envelope and no automatic Enter. One call sends exactly one tmux argument — there is no sequence syntax, so `scion keys <agent> "Up Up Enter"` types eleven literal characters, not three key presses; send each key press as a separate call. Works for container-backed agents in local and Hub mode; not supported for managed-runtime agents. As an agent, you can only target agents in your own project — cross-project targets are refused. **Authority:** in Hub mode, `scion keys` is authorized like terminal attach, not like messaging — being able to message an agent does not mean you can send it keys, and as an agent caller you also need a live attach relationship on the target, not just shared project membership. Each call reports `dispatched`, `rejected`, or `unknown`; on `unknown`, check with `scion look` before resending.
- **Scheduled messages**: Use `scion schedule create` to schedule messages for future delivery. See the `scion-scheduler` skill.
- **Notifications**: Use `scion notifications subscribe` to subscribe to agent state changes.

## Agent-to-Agent Coordination Patterns

- **Coordinator**: Workers often collaborate on shared work through the coordinator rather than directly with each other. This guidance may be set by the coordinator on startup.
- **Avoid being a relay.** If an agent needs to communicate something to a user, have them message the user directly rather than relaying through you. Relay adds latency, risks reframing the message in transit, and wastes context.
- **Self-Callback Heartbeat**: For very long external tasks, use `scion schedule create` to send yourself a reminder to check on the process or provide a status update. (during long blocked periods)

## Conversation Management

In projects with multiple users:
- Reply to direct messages from each user independently.
- Do not repeat messages in a group for each user you've interacted with in that group, assume they can see it, use mentions if you want to draw a specific user's attention to a message.
- Handle each user's requests within their own context.

For managing conversation metadata, participants, and message history, see the
`scion-conversation` skill. The `scion conversation` command handles reading
and administration; `scion message` handles sending.

## Message Length Limit

Messages to **users** (agent-to-human-inbox path) are limited to **2000
characters** (counted as Unicode runes, not bytes — CJK and emoji each
count as one character). Agent-to-agent messages have **no enforced cap
in code** and are not subject to this limit, but remember to keep message content focused. Longer findings can be written to a shared file and sent as a reference.

When the limit is exceeded, the command returns a non-zero exit code and
prints the error (`validation_error: message exceeds 2000 character limit`)
to `stderr`. Redirect `stderr` (e.g., `2>&1`) to see it.

If your user-directed message is long:
- Split it into two or more messages, each under ~1800 characters.
- Or write the content to a shared file and send as an attachment.

## Inbound Message Types

Messages arrive wrapped in `---BEGIN SCION MESSAGE---` / `---END SCION MESSAGE---`
markers as a JSON envelope containing sender, type, and conversation metadata.

### Direct vs group conversations

**Check the `conversation.kind` field first.** It tells you the shape of the conversation you are in:

- **`"direct"`** — a one-to-one conversation between you and the sender. Messages here are addressed to you. The `to` field is usually omitted (your identity is implicit).
- **`"group"`** — a multi-participant conversation. The `to` field lists all addressees who were named explicitly but does NOT contain every entity in the group who sees messages in that conversation. Read the message, but be aware others received it too — avoid duplicate work unless the message specifically assigns you a task.

When `conversation` is absent, the message predates the conversation model. Treat it like a direct message unless other context suggests otherwise.

### The `type` field

Within a conversation, the `type` field classifies how the message reached you:

- **`"message"`** — a text message addressed to you (directly or as part of a group). Read and act on it as appropriate.
- **`"event"`** — a lifecycle notification about another agent or the system. Check the `event.type` subfield for the specific event:
  - `agent.state-changed` — an agent changed state (e.g., completed, stalled). No reply needed. Action is situational.
  - `agent.input-needed` — an agent is waiting for input. See [Handling `input-needed`](#handling-input-needed) below.
  - `delivery.failed` — a message you sent could not be delivered.
  - `schedule.fired` — a scheduled event fired (see the `scion-scheduler` skill).
  - `port.exposed` — an auto-exposed port notification.
- **`"mention"`** — you were @-mentioned in a message primarily addressed to someone else. **Default to treating this as FYI — no action required.** Only act if the message text explicitly directs you to do something (e.g., "@agent-X, please review this PR"). Being CC'd or name-dropped in passing is not a request. When in doubt, do nothing.

### Conversation routing

Inbound messages carry a `conversation` field with an `id` that identifies the conversation. When replying, use `conv:<id>` addressing so the reply stays in the same conversation:

```bash
scion message conv:<conversation-id> "your reply"
```

An agent that omits the conversation ID sends a proactive DM instead of a reply — correct for starting new conversations, wrong for replies. Always read the `conversation.id` from the message you are replying to and route your reply into it.

**Do not reply by addressing the sender instead.** `@<email>` (or
`@<agent-name>`) opens a *direct* conversation with that principal — on a
different surface/thread than a group conversation you were addressed in. If
you received a message with `conversation.kind: "group"` and you reply with
`@<sender-email>` instead of `conv:<id>`, your reply goes to that user's
native DM, not back into the group conversation they were watching — to them,
it looks exactly like you never replied. This is the single most common
addressing mistake: when in doubt about how to reply, use `conv:<id>` from the
message you're responding to, not the sender's identity.

### Handling `input-needed`

When an agent calls `sciontool status ask_user`, the hub dispatches the question as an event (`type: "event"`, `event.type: "agent.input-needed"`) to that agent's subscribers.

**Decision tree when you receive one:**

1. **Am I the parent that created this agent?** → You are likely the intended respondent. Read the question and reply with `scion message @<agent-name> "your answer"`.
2. **Am I a peer or unrelated subscriber?** → Ignore it. The agent is waiting for its parent or a human, and your reply will not unblock it. Repeated appearances are status re-signals, not impatience.

**Why ignoring matters when you are not the parent:**
- Wasted tokens — the reply goes nowhere useful.
- False loop signals — repeated echoes look like a stuck agent.
- **Scope violations** — answering a question meant for someone else can make a recommendation look ratified.

**To request a peer's input, send a direct message** via `scion message @<agent-name>`. Do not rely on your `ask_user` status signal to reach them — it is a broadcast to subscribers, not a delivery to an addressee.

## Anti-Patterns and Red Flags

- **Red Flag**: Attempting to broadcast. Broadcasting is not available in agent mode; address recipients explicitly.
- **Red Flag**: An agent goes silent for >30 minutes without a milestone update or "blocked" status.
- **Anti-Pattern**: Sending "I'm still here" or other low-signal filler messages.
- **Anti-Pattern**: Using `sleep` to wait for something; use `sciontool status blocked` instead. For external processes that emit no notification (CI, builds, deploys), pair `status blocked` with a scheduled self-callback — see the `scion-scheduler` skill → **Waiting on external processes**.
- **Anti-Pattern**: Sending a multi-sentence message as one dense paragraph, or listing choices inline ("A) ... B) ... Which?") instead of as a list.
- **Anti-Pattern**: Repeating the entire original brief in a follow-up message (exhausts context).
- **Anti-Pattern**: JSON-encoding or escaping the message body before passing to `scion message`. The CLI delivers the body verbatim — use real newlines in shell strings or heredocs.
- **Anti-Pattern**: Replying to a group-conversation message by addressing the
  sender directly (`@<email>`) instead of the conversation (`conv:<id>`). This
  silently reroutes the reply to a DM the original watchers never see.

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Does the message have a clear recipient (`@<agent>`, `@<email>`, `agent:`, `user:`, or `group[]`)?
- [ ] Is the preferred `@<agent-name>` form used (rather than legacy `agent:<name>`)?
- [ ] Is the message functional and free of filler/banter?
- [ ] Does it include concrete references (paths, IDs, errors)?
- [ ] If the message is more than a sentence or two, does it start with a bold headline and use bullets?
- [ ] If a decision is needed, are the options a list (one per item) with a marked recommendation, and is the ask on its own line?
- [ ] For long tasks, has a milestone reporting cadence been established?
- [ ] If this is a reply to an inbound message, am I using `conv:<id>` from that message's `conversation.id` — not addressing the sender directly?
