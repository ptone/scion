// PTY WebSocket close-code contract.

// (Hub -> web/CLI client), and in StreamCloseMessage.Code on the Hub <-> broker
// control channel. The rule is that the hop that knows the cause chooses the
// code, and later hops pass it through unchanged; a specific code is never
// downgraded to 1000.
//
// Application codes use the RFC 6455 private range 4000-4999 as 4000 + the
// nearest HTTP status. Reasons are machine-readable snake_case strings of at
// most MaxCloseReasonBytes bytes.
//
// The client-side mirror of ClassifyPTYClose lives in
// web/src/client/terminal-close-codes.ts. Both are checked against
// testdata/pty_close_codes.json; change all three together.
