// LabelsMatchFilter reports whether labels satisfy every key/value pair in
// filter. The Docker, Podman and Apple runtimes apply it to each
// container's labels, and agent.AgentManager.List's on-disk scan applies it
// to the label set a created (not yet started) agent's container would
// carry, so those paths cannot drift. Other runtimes filter their own way
// and do not use it: Kubernetes passes the filter to the API server as a
// label selector, which compares every key exactly, including the project
// path, and Cloud Run has its own List.
//
// Each key is compared with projectkeys.LabelValuesMatch: the project path
// is compared as a resolved path, every other key exactly. A key that is
// absent from labels reads as "" and therefore never matches a non-empty
// wanted value. An empty or nil filter matches everything.
