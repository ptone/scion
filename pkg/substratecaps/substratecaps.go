// Package substratecaps is the single source of truth for the Linux
// capabilities a Substrate actor's container must be granted, beyond
// Substrate's own minimal default set (AUDIT_WRITE, KILL,
// NET_BIND_SERVICE), for substrate-serve's privilege drop to actually
// succeed.
//
// Two independent consumers must never drift apart:
//   - pkg/runtime's buildActorTemplate grants exactly this set on the
//     actor's container SecurityContext;
//   - cmd/sciontool/commands's checkPrivilegeDropFeasible (substrate-
//     serve's synchronous /bootstrap precondition) verifies every one of
//     them is effective before /bootstrap ever responds 200.
//
// A capability present in one list but not the other is exactly the
// defect class this package exists to prevent: a template missing a
// capability the checker doesn't know to ask for would pass the
// precondition and then fail deep inside RunInit instead (observed live —
// see Required's CHOWN entry). This package has no
// dependencies beyond the standard library, so both pkg/runtime (broker-
// side, heavy k8s/grpc dependencies) and cmd/sciontool/commands (the
// agent-side sciontool binary, which must stay light and must never
// import pkg/runtime) can import it without pulling in the other's
// dependencies or creating an import cycle.
package substratecaps

// Capability names a single required Linux capability.
type Capability struct {
	// Name is the capability name the way Substrate's
	// ContainerSpec.Capabilities.Add expects it: no CAP_ prefix (see the
	// vendored third_party/ateapipb types), e.g. "SETUID".
	Name string

	// EffBit is Name's bit position in /proc/self/status's CapEff field —
	// the standard Linux capability number (e.g. CAP_SETUID = 7) — used to
	// verify the capability is actually held.
	EffBit uint

	// Why documents, with a citation, the specific evidence that this
	// capability is required. Kept on the struct (rather than only in a
	// comment) so it can be surfaced in logs/documentation generated from
	// this list, and so adding a capability without a reason is visibly
	// awkward.
	Why string
}

// Required lists every capability substrate-serve's privilege drop needs.
// Order matters only for readability; nothing depends on it.
var Required = []Capability{
	{
		Name:   "SETUID",
		EffBit: 7,
		Why:    "su (via execAsUserCmd, used by `sciontool substrate-serve exec`) and the supervisor's own syscall.Credential drop (pkg/sciontool/supervisor's Run, which execs the harness with a Uid/Gid-bearing Credential) both need CAP_SETUID to leave root.",
	},
	{
		Name:   "SETGID",
		EffBit: 6,
		Why:    "su and the supervisor's own syscall.Credential drop also both need CAP_SETGID (setgroups(2)/setgid(2)) to leave root, for the same two consumers as SETUID.",
	},
	{
		Name:   "CHOWN",
		EffBit: 0,
		Why:    `Observed live: "Failed to chown log file: chown /home/scion/agent.log: operation not permitted" and "Failed to chown workspace to UID=1000 GID=1000: chown /workspace: operation not permitted", followed by "Git clone failed: git init failed" and init exiting 1. RunInit unconditionally chowns the log file (log.Chown) and the workspace/home tree (chownTreeRootOwned/ensureWorkspaceOwnership) from root to the scion user once a drop is expected, and chown(2) to an arbitrary uid/gid needs CAP_CHOWN once a process's capability set is restricted — the same "still UID 0 isn't still all-powerful" property that made SETUID/SETGID necessary for su in the first place.`,
