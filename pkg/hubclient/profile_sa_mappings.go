// ProfileSAMappingsState is one Kubernetes profile's GCP service account
// report in a heartbeat (BrokerHeartbeat.ProfileSAMappings): the GSAs the
// profile can serve and the Kubernetes ServiceAccount (KSA) each runs as,
// from the broker's global kubernetes_service_account_mappings (profile
// plus runtime entry) and from ServiceAccount annotation discovery in the
// profile's namespace (ptone/scion#3329 phases 2 and 4).
//
// The broker sends the full report of every Kubernetes profile when any
// profile's report changes, and when the Hub asks for it
// (BrokerHeartbeatResponse.ProfileSAMappingsRequested). Every heartbeat
// carries the hash of each profile's report
// (BrokerHeartbeat.ProfileSAMappingsHashes), so the Hub can confirm that
// its stored copy is current without the full list. The Hub stores the
// report on the named profile (store.BrokerProfile.ServiceAccountMappings
// and related fields). An entry with an empty list means the profile maps
// nothing. The Hub ignores names it has no stored profile for, and drops
// the field for brokers that store no profiles (flat Runtime Broker rows).
//
// An entry means "mapped", not "ready": the broker cannot see whether the
// Workload Identity IAM binding exists.
