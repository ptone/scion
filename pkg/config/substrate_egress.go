// entries feed, explicitly rejects IP addresses; CIDRRule support is
// deferred to a later phase, review round 4, R4-2). The full public-suffix
// acceptance rule is isolated in egressAllowSuffixOK; see its doc comment
// for the exact checks (a special-use-TLD block ahead of everything else,
// an ICANN-listed-TLD check, at least one label beneath the domain's own
// matched suffix — ICANN or PRIVATE — and, for a wildcard entry only, a
// third check against wildcard PSL rules).
//
// The public-suffix requirement replaced round 3's "last label is
// alphabetic" rule, which is a proxy for "looks like a TLD" but not for "is
// a real, publicly-delegated one" — it let through Kubernetes' own `pod`/
// `svc` DNS zones, `home.arpa` (RFC 8375), and made-up zones like `lan`/
// `corp`, all of which resolve inside a cluster or a local network rather
// than on the public Internet (review round 4, R4-1: `169-254-169-254.
// default.pod` resolves to the GKE metadata server on any cluster, no
// cluster-specific knowledge required).
//
// The rule went through one refinement in round 4 itself: the first
// version required the domain's own matched suffix to be ICANN-managed,
// which correctly rejected "pod"/"svc"/"lan"/"corp", but also rejected
// legitimate hostnames on multi-tenant platforms whose PSL entry is in the
// PRIVATE section rather than ICANN's — "storage.googleapis.com" (Google
// Cloud) and "foo.github.io" (GitHub Pages) both fail an "ICANN suffix
// only" check, since "googleapis.com" and "github.io" are PRIVATE PSL
// entries. Substrate-lead's approved refinement splits the check in two:
// the top-level domain alone must be ICANN-listed (a real TLD), but the
// "at least one label beneath the suffix" check is evaluated against
// whichever suffix — ICANN or PRIVATE — actually matches the full domain.
// That accepts real hostnames on private-suffix platforms while still
// rejecting the bare platform domain itself ("googleapis.com",
// "*.googleapis.com", "*.github.io") and everything round 4 originally
// targeted ("pod", "svc", "lan", "corp", the numeric typo "kom").
//
// Round 5 (sb-rev-5) found and substrate-lead approved two more
// refinements to the same public-suffix check, plus two smaller fixes, all
// in egressAllowSuffixOK/validatePublicHostname:
//
//   - N5-1: a wildcard entry over a remainder that isn't itself a public
//     suffix, but where every single-label child of it IS one (a PSL
//     *wildcard* rule, like "*.run.app" or "*.compute.amazonaws.com"), is
//     now rejected — that grants every tenant on the platform, the same
//     class of problem a bare wildcard over "googleapis.com" is.
//   - N5-2: TLD-ness is now decided from
//     publicsuffix.PublicSuffix("x."+tld)'s icann flag, not
//     publicsuffix.PublicSuffix(tld)'s — several real ccTLDs ("ck", "er",
//     "fk", "jm", "kh", "mm", "np", "pg") have only a wildcard rule in the
//     PSL and no bare-TLD rule, so checking the bare label alone gave a
//     false-fails-closed rejection for every host under them.
//   - special-use: ".onion" (RFC 7686, Tor hidden services) is rejected
//     the same way ".arpa" is, via egressAllowSpecialUseTLDs — like
//     "arpa", "onion" is itself ICANN-listed, so the generic check alone
//     would not catch it.
//   - N5-3: a single-label wildcard remainder ("*.com", "*.co", "*.bd")
//     now reaches the public-suffix check and gets that check's message,
//     instead of being intercepted earlier by the "not fully qualified"
//     single-label message, which was misleading for a wildcard over a
//     bare TLD.
//
// Residual risk, not closed by this or any DNS-name-shape check: an
// ICANN-valid public hostname can still be configured (by its owner, or by
// an attacker exploiting DNS rebinding) to resolve to a private or
// in-cluster IP address — services like nip.io/sslip.io do this
// deliberately and by design, and a wildcard entry over one of them
// authorizes every address it might ever hand out. Only a check performed
// by the egress proxy itself, after DNS resolution, against the address it
// actually connects to, can close that; no client-side allowlist over the
// name alone can.
//
// A leading "*." wildcard label is accepted, but the remainder after it
// must independently satisfy the same rule — "*.com", "*.co", "*.bd", and
// "*.co.uk" are all rejected (the remainder is itself a public suffix with
// no label beneath it, or — round 5's N5-1 — the remainder's own children
// are all public suffixes via a PSL wildcard rule, as with
// "*.run.app"/"*.compute.amazonaws.com"/"*.compute-1.amazonaws.com"/
// "*.kawasaki.jp"), while "*.example.com" passes ("example.com" has
// "example" beneath the "com" suffix, and "com" has no PSL wildcard rule).
//
// Entries are also capped at egressAllowMaxLength characters (round 5,
// N5-4), counting a wildcard prefix if present, matching the standard DNS
// presentation-form limit.
//
// The existing in-cluster/loopback/local hostname suffix and exact-name
// blocklists (egressAllowBlockedHostSuffixes, egressAllowBlockedHostNames)
// remain as a second layer on top of the public-suffix check, per
// substrate-lead's direction — redundant against everything the public
// suffix list already excludes, but not dependent on it staying that way.
//
// Empty entries are ignored. The returned error names the offending entry
// as originally written, before normalization.

//
// egressAllowSpecialUseTLDs is checked first, unconditionally: some
// ICANN-listed labels ("arpa", "onion") are carved out for a special use
// other than ordinary public hosts, which rule 1 below would not catch on
// its own since they genuinely are ICANN-listed.
//
// Two checks after that, both required:
//
//  1. The top-level domain (the last label) must itself be an
//     ICANN-managed public suffix. Checked as
//     publicsuffix.PublicSuffix("x."+lastLabel), not
//     publicsuffix.PublicSuffix(lastLabel) (review round 5, N5-2): several
//     real ccTLDs — "ck", "er", "fk", "jm", "kh", "mm", "np", "pg" — have
//     only a wildcard rule ("*.ck") in the PSL, no bare-TLD rule, so
//     PublicSuffix("ck") alone falls through to the unmanaged default and
//     wrongly reports icann==false. Prepending a throwaway label makes the
//     wildcard rule match, so the check works the same way for a
//     wildcard-only ccTLD as for an ordinary one. This is what rejects
//     Kubernetes' own DNS zones ("pod", "svc"), special-use and made-up
//     zones ("lan", "corp"), and typos ("kom") — none of these is a real
//     top-level domain at all, ICANN-managed or otherwise, whether checked
//     bare or with a prepended label.
//  2. The domain must have at least one label beneath its OWN matched
//     public suffix — which may be a PRIVATE-section entry, not only an
//     ICANN one. The public suffix list's PRIVATE section exists
//     precisely for multi-tenant platforms where each subdomain is
//     operated by a different, mutually untrusting party: "googleapis.com"
//     (Google Cloud) and "github.io" (GitHub Pages) are both PRIVATE
//     entries. Treating rule 1 alone as sufficient would accept
//     "googleapis.com" or "*.googleapis.com" as if the whole platform were
//     a single hostname; requiring a label beneath the actual (possibly
//     private) suffix accepts "storage.googleapis.com" and
//     "foo.github.io" — real, specific hostnames on those platforms — while
//     still rejecting the bare platform domain and any wildcard directly
//     over it.
//
// A third check applies only when wildcard is true (review round 5, N5-1):
// some PSL suffixes are *wildcard* rules rather than bare ones — "run.app",
// "compute.amazonaws.com", "compute-1.amazonaws.com", "kawasaki.jp" are
// none of them a public suffix by themselves (so rule 2 lets them through:
// "run.app" is a perfectly good specific host, one label under the "app"
// TLD), but every single label prepended to one of them IS its own public
// suffix — the exact multi-tenant-platform shape rule 2 exists to catch —
// so a wildcard entry over the bare remainder ("*.run.app") would grant
// every tenant on the platform, not one specific host, the same problem a
// bare wildcard over "googleapis.com"/"github.io" would be if rule 2 didn't
// already catch those directly. Detected the same way rule 1 detects a
// wildcard-only ccTLD: prepend a throwaway label and ask whether the whole
// thing still comes back as the public suffix.
