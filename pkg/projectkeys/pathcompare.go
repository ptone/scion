// lexically, so a ".." segment is collapsed before symlinks are resolved,
// rather than being applied physically against whatever the preceding
// component resolves to — then resolved through filepath.EvalSymlinks, so a
// path recorded before a directory was renamed to a new name (with a symlink
// left behind at the old one) compares equal to its canonical replacement.

// falls back to filepath.Clean, so two equally unresolvable paths still
// compare consistently instead of erroring.
