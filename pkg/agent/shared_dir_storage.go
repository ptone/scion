// resolveSharedDirs is the single resolution point for a project's shared
// directories, used by both container runtimes (design
// deploy-config-explore §3.2.2/§3.2.3): given one settings file, Docker's
// bind-mount source and Kubernetes' PVC subPath must resolve to the same
// projects/<pid>/shared-dirs/<name> path under the same base.
//
// When sdCfg is nil or its Backend is "" / "local", behaviour is
// byte-identical to today: shared dirs are ensured and mounted under the
// broker-local layout, and errors are logged and swallowed rather than
// failing agent start (matching the pre-existing run.go:952-972 behaviour).
//
// When sdCfg.Backend is "nfs", resolution fails closed (design G5): a
// missing project ID or a missing NFS host base (on a local-container
// runtime) return an error instead of silently falling back to local disk.
// The returned SharedDirRealization is nil unless backend is "nfs"; it is
// consumed by the Kubernetes runtime's buildPod to mount the shared PVC by
// subPath instead of creating per-dir dynamic PVCs.
//
// Keep the nfs branch in lockstep with runtime.ResolveSharedDirHostPath,
// which chat plugins use to find the same directories: both apply the same
// path checks (name and project ID validation, Resolve, ConfineLeaf,
// ValidateNotExportRoot, host-base stat refusal, EvalSymlinks of the host
// base, EnsureLeaf, then the resolved-path backstop). Both chains now
// call ValidateNotExportRoot right after ConfineLeaf: here via
// NFSSharedDirsToVolumeMounts, there directly. A change to either chain
// must be made to both; TestSharedDirChainsParity runs one table of
