// distinct credentials (e.g. two projects' same-named secret) never collide
// either — the same guarantee cacheKey gives Get/Put, applied here to
// coalescing and the cap. The accepted cost: a GitHub App token minted fresh
// for every create does not coalesce, or share a cap slot, with another mint
// for the same repo on the broker fallback path, since each mint is its own
// value and gets its own fingerprint.
//
// logRef is a credential-free label (ref plus the general kind of source,
// never the credential's value, its fingerprint, or a secret's name) used
