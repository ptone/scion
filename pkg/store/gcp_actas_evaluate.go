// EvaluateActAs is the single decision sequence for "may this caller act as
// this service account", shared by every surface that gates on it.
//
// ⚠️ IT EXISTS TO BE THE ONLY COPY. Two surfaces gate on this today — agent
// service-account assignment in pkg/hub and lifecycle-hook execution identity
// in pkg/lifecyclehooks — and the ordering below is security-relevant at every
// step. Reimplemented per surface, the copies drift, and the drift is invisible
// because each one looks locally reasonable. Surfaces are expected to differ in
// how they REPORT the result (HTTP 403 versus a FieldError) and in what they
// log; they must not differ in how they REACH it.
//
// The sequence, in order, with the reason each step is where it is:
//
//  1. Nil target denies. Nothing to check.
//  2. Nil checker denies, Mechanism "check-unwired". A nil checker is a wiring
//     bug and must be loud. It is placed BEFORE the same-account fast path on
//     purpose: a fast path that succeeds while the gate is unwired would mask
//     the bug for exactly the callers most likely to exercise it.
//  3. Same-account allows without contacting GCP. A caller configuring the
//     account it already acts as grants nothing it does not already have, so
//     there is no privilege to escalate. Both emails must be non-empty, or an
//     empty-equals-empty match would turn every caller with no GCP identity
//     into a permitted user of a malformed account.
//  4. A caller with no GCP identity denies. Block-mode and passthrough-mode
//     agents, and unknown or broker callers, have nothing that could have been
//     granted actAs. Nothing to check means no, and it means no without a
//     round-trip.
//  5. Otherwise the checker decides.
//
// An error from the checker is diagnostic and carries no verdict, per the
// CallerPermissionChecker contract. It is returned to the caller for logging,
// but the whole result is replaced: outcome forced to ActAsIndeterminate,
// mechanism to MechanismCheckFailed, reason to one that says no verdict was
// obtained. A checker returning (Allowed, err) is malformed and this is the one
// place that can stop it becoming an allow — and a preserved reason from a call
// that never answered is worse than no reason at all, because it reads as
// evidence that IAM was consulted.
//
// THE RESULT IS ALWAYS ATTRIBUTABLE. Mechanism is never empty on return, and an
// ALLOW that arrives without one is downgraded to indeterminate rather than
// stamped and honoured — see MechanismUnattributableAllow. An audit record that
// cannot say which check produced a permit is the failure the mechanism field
// exists to prevent, and it is only ever missed during an incident.
