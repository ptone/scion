// Source-scan guard for DEF-112: verifies that ListProjects contains no
// unconditional query.Where() call. An unconditional filter silently
// breaks the reachable/unreachable message split in the residual
// attribution report (design §4.6):
//
//   - CountUnreachableUnbackfilledMessages uses NOT EXISTS (... FROM
//     projects ...) to identify messages whose project row is absent.
//   - The backfill iterates ListProjects(ctx, ProjectFilter{}, ...) to
//     determine which messages it can reach.
//   - These agree only because ListProjects with an empty filter returns
//     every project row — NOT EXISTS is its exact complement.
//
// An unconditional filter (e.g. excluding archived projects) would cause
// ListProjects to return fewer projects than the table contains. Messages
// in filtered-out projects become unreachable in fact but classified as
// reachable by the counter. The WARN fires on every boot with a number
// no action can reduce — exactly the alarm-fatigue bug M6 existed to fix.
//
// This test catches unconditional filters that no data-driven test can
// detect: a filter keyed on archived/deleted/visibility/template status
// would exclude no row in a test database where all rows are at their
// defaults, so the consistency test (TestReachableCountConsistency_DEF112
// in cmd/) would pass while the drift ships to production.
//
// The two guards together are stronger than either alone:
//   - This test catches the structural violation regardless of seed data.
//   - The consistency test catches semantic drift from any cause,
//     including helper functions that hide the filter from source scanning.

// sit inside if/switch/for blocks at two or more tabs.

// Known limitation: a multi-line call split as query.\n\t\tWhere(...)
// would not be detected. This is unlikely under gofmt for a simple
// single-predicate call, and the consistency test guards against it.
