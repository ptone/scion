package hub

// Symlink confinement for attachment ingest and staging.
//
// Both directions cross the same boundary: a project's scratchpad shared dir
// is bind-mounted read-write into every agent in the project, so every path
// component under it is content the hub does not control. Ingest reads a file
// an agent names there and publishes it into a chat; staging writes a file
// there for an agent to read. A link planted in between turns the first into
// an arbitrary read and the second into an arbitrary write.
//
// A leaf check is not enough for either. Lstat declines to follow only the
// final component, so a link at any directory above it is still traversed by
// the very syscall that was supposed to be refusing links. The cases below
// therefore plant the link at a directory component as well as at the leaf.
//
// The link shapes and the outside tree come from the file-browser matrix in
// project_workspace_symlink_test.go; the assertions are the same two. Nothing
// outside the shared dir may be read — checked against the bytes that reach
// the attachment store, which is where a leak would surface here rather than
// in a response body — and nothing outside it may change, checked against a
// full content snapshot.
