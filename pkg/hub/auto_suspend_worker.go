// The auto-suspend worker (ptone/scion#4387). The stalled-detection tick
// only marks agents stalled, publishes their status and hands the agents to
// this worker, so the tick returns within its own bound
// (stalledDetectionTimeout) and never holds a scheduler slot while agents
// are suspended. The worker is owned by the server:
//
//   - At most one worker goroutine runs at a time, so two batches are never
//     processed at once. It is started on demand by a hand-off and exits
//     when nothing is pending, so an idle server runs no goroutine for it.
//   - The hand-off is a pending set deduplicated by agent ID: an agent
//     already waiting, or in the batch being processed, is not added again,
//     so overlapping ticks cannot suspend an agent twice. The set holds at
//     most autoSuspendQueueLimit agents; agents beyond it are dropped (and
//     logged) and stay stalled.
//   - Agents handed off while a batch is being processed wait in the set.
//     When the batch ends, the worker takes everything pending as the next
//     batch, which gets its own start window (autoSuspendStalledAgents).
//   - The worker runs on the server-lifetime ctx. Shutdown cancels it, so
//     no new agent's auto-suspend starts, and stopAutoSuspendWorker waits
//     (bounded) for the one in flight.

// autoSuspendQueueLimit bounds the agents waiting for, or being processed
// by, the auto-suspend worker. A variable so tests can change it.
