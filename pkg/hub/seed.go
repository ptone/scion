	// The human half of the svc-accnt service-account assign baseline is

	// existing projects by backfillProjectAssignPolicies below. See
	// projectAssignPolicyName for why hub scope was rejected.
}

// projectAssignPolicyName returns the name of a project's service-account
// assign policy. Policy names are unique hub-wide, which is what makes both
// the per-project creation path and the startup backfill idempotent.
//
// ── Why this policy exists ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Assigning a service account to an agent is gated today on ActionRead, which
// the hub-wide hub-member-read-all policy already allows for every hub member.
// svc-accnt P3 converts that gate to ActionAssign so the GCP actAs check has a
// resource-shaped place to hang. Without an assign grant somewhere, that
// conversion would deny every caller who is neither the account's creator nor
// a project owner or admin, since no other seeded policy grants assign. The
// security in that change comes from the actAs check, not from narrowing the
// Hub policy layer — a conversion that denies someone who can assign today is
// a regression, not a hardening.
//
// The population it must reproduce is exactly "members of this project":
//   - seed.go's hub-member-read-all grants read+list on "*" hub-wide, which is
//     what makes assign reachable for plain members today via the ActionRead
//     gate; and
//   - createProjectMembersGroupAndPolicy binds agent create as a PROJECT-scoped
//     policy to the members group, so only members of project P can create an
//     agent in P in the first place.
//
// Effective population today == project members. This policy reproduces it.
//
// ── Why project scope and not hub scope ───────────────────────────────────
//
// A hub-scoped assign policy on gcp_service_account cannot exclude parentless
// resources, so it would grant assign on every HUB-scoped service account to
// every hub member — which is the Goal 2 coupling arriving early, through the
// policy layer, before it has been ruled on.
//
// Project scope dissolves that structurally rather than managing it:
// matchesResource rejects a project-scoped policy against a resource that
// resolves to no project ("pid == ” || pid != policy.ScopeID", fail closed
// rather than fall through — #595). gcpServiceAccountResource gives a project
// parent only to project-scoped accounts, so a hub-scoped account yields
// pid == "" and this policy CANNOT match it. No code-side guard is needed, and
// none should be added: a policy that presents as applied but is revoked
// elsewhere is the shape this change exists to avoid.
//
// ⚠️ WHAT CONFINES THIS POLICY is matchesResource alone: it refuses to match a
// project-scoped policy against a resource that resolves to no project (#595).
// That is a property of the authorization engine. It holds no matter what any
// handler does, and it is the only thing that needs to be true.
//
// Do NOT justify this policy by the scope check in createAgentInProject. An
// earlier version of this comment named `sa.ScopeID != projectID` there as an
// enforcing mechanism; a44b2950 replaced it with sa.ReachableFromProject,
// which admits hub-scoped accounts from every project. The justification went
// stale while the policy stayed correct for a reason the comment had not
// recorded. A confinement argument that names a call site can be invalidated
// by a commit to that call site, silently. Name engine properties only.
//
// The agent-side arm (step 3b of checkAccessForAgent) is confined by the SAME
// engine property read the other way: that arm by `pid != ""`, this policy by
// `pid == ""` in matchesResource. One discipline in two places, not two
// unrelated accidents.
//
// Goal 2 makes hub-scoped accounts assignable across projects. That does not
// breach this policy — a hub-scoped account stays parentless, so this policy
// still cannot match it, which is the fail-closed outcome §8.2 rules correct:
// hub-scoped accounts are assignable by hub admins and the account's creator
// and nobody else. If you are here to make hub-scoped accounts broadly
// assignable, that is task #19, and doing it by adding a hub-scoped assign
// policy would grant every hub member every service account on the hub.
//
// ⚠️ #19 CONSTRAINT: whatever implements that toggle must NOT do it by
// deleting or editing a grant by name. CreatePolicy enforces no name
// uniqueness, so a name identifies a SET of rows, and ListPolicies(Name:X,
// Limit:1) returns an arbitrary element of it. Additive operations are safe;
// revocation by name is not.
//
// ── Scope of the "preserves existing reach" claim ─────────────────────────
//
// It restores the reach of hub-member-read-all for project members and nothing
// else. The action-insensitive bypasses — hub admin, resource owner, project
// owner/admin — never consulted the action and are unaffected. A hand-authored
// policy granting read on service accounts to some other group is deliberately
// NOT mirrored, because a grant to read a service account is not a grant to
// assign one. Such an operator loses assign for that group and must grant it
// explicitly. Do not describe this policy as "reachability-preserving" without
// that qualification.

// policy and binds it to the project's members group. It is idempotent, and an
// existing policy has its ScopeID repaired in case the project was recreated.
// Best-effort; failures are logged.
//
// ResourceType is the single literal "gcp_service_account" and not "*".
// hub-member-read-all uses the wildcard because read is broadly safe; assign
// is not, so this mirrors that policy's reach without inheriting its breadth.
// Actions is assign alone for the same reason.
//
// ⚠️ Idempotency is by name LOOKUP, the way seedPolicy does it — deliberately
// not by creating and catching store.ErrAlreadyExists. CreatePolicy does not
// enforce name uniqueness, so that error never arrives and the catch would be
// dead code: three project touches would produce three identical policies.
// This is a live defect on the neighbouring project:<slug>:member-create-agents
// policy above, which does use the catch pattern. Do not "simplify" this back
// to create-then-catch, and do not assume a uniqueness constraint exists.
