// The package-exit leak guard (ptone/scion#3641) catches the class of leak
// that used to surface only when the memory guard (mem_guard_helpers_test.go)
// hit its cap: test stores that are never closed, and servers built with
// New() that are never shut down. Each unclosed *sql.DB keeps a
// database/sql.(*DB).connectionOpener goroutine (and about 3 MiB of
// in-memory SQLite) alive until the binary exits, and each server that is
// never shut down keeps its background loops, and through them the whole
// server graph, reachable.
//
// At package exit, checkPackageLeaks counts the goroutines whose stack
// contains one of leakGuardSignatures and fails the run when the total is
// above leakGuardMaxGoroutines, printing every offending stack so the
// creating test helper is easy to find (run with
// GODEBUG=tracebackancestors=20 to also see the full creation chain).
//
// Why an absolute threshold bounds the full single-process CI run: these
// goroutines only exit when their owner is closed. A test that leaks one
// leaks it for the rest of the process, so the count at the end of the
// full package is the sum of what every test leaks. Running the package
// in shards partitions the tests, so the full-package count is the sum of
// the per-shard end counts. After the fix, every measured shard ends at 0
// (see the ci-3641 report), so the full package also ends at 0. The
// threshold leaves room for a handful of goroutines still winding down
// after an asynchronous close; it is far below a real regression, which
// shows up as one goroutine per test run of the leaking test.
