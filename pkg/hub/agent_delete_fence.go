// Delete dispatch fencing (ptone/scion#2906).
//
// A delete the engine sends can reach the broker after the engine's claim
// has lapsed (queued in the network, a slow broker, a frozen hub that
// resumed). By then the row reads failed/abandoned and the user may have
// started the agent again, and run_id cannot tell a same-run start (one that
// adopted the surviving run) from the run the delete was for. So the engine
// sends a deadline, notAfter = min(its lease expiry, now + its dispatch
// budget) less deleteNotAfterMargin, and the broker refuses a delete that arrives after it with 409
// stale_dispatch and no side effects. notAfter is a wire field only: nothing
// stores it. A delete from any other caller carries none, and the broker
// then does not check.
//
// The margin points toward refusal: the hub allows a start as soon as the
// lease expires, and the broker accepts up to deleteNotAfterMargin past
// notAfter (its own skew allowance), so the hub subtracts the same margin
// from the lease. With synchronised clocks the broker's last accepted
// instant is then the lease expiry. A broker clock further ahead of the
// hub's refuses in-time deletes (safe: the hub retries); one further behind
// accepts late deletes, past the lease expiry by the skew beyond the margin.
//
// A cross-node (deferred) delete carries the engine's claim instead, in
// DeleteDispatchArgs. The executing node re-reads the row, drops the intent
// unless that claim is still the current one and the intent may still run
// (see deferredDeleteDeadline), and computes notAfter when it actually
// sends. The dispatch table already blocks a start while a delete intent is
// outstanding (deleteBlocksStart), so the re-check mostly drops superseded
// or abandoned intents; the deadline it adds closes the remaining gap, where
// the intent fails on a timeout while the broker is still working.

// errStaleDeleteDispatch is the error for a delete that was not acted on
// because it was stale: the broker answered 409 stale_dispatch, or a
// deferred intent was dropped because its claim was no longer live.
