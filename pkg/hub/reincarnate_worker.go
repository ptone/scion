// whatever step it is failing out of) — rather than a value read fresh off
// the record (design §3.4 Amendment A8.1). A fresh read cannot be trusted as
// expectState: it can return an already-terminal value (the replica-safe
// sweep, or a racing completion, resolved the record while this call was
// stalled), and a CAS "WHERE state = 'failed'" against an already-'failed'
// row would trivially match itself, letting a stale caller "win" a race it
// actually lost. Knowing fromState up front also means there is no read to
// race against the sweep in the first place: the check and the write are
// the same conditional UPDATE.
//
// It sets the record's State to newState plus whatever mutate applies
// (Error, CompletedAt, NewAppliedConfig), and CASes the write through
// store.TryAdvanceAgentReincarnation. It returns the instant it stamped on
// the record (zero if it never got that far) alongside the CAS result, so
// the caller can pin the SAME instant onto the paired agent-row write
// (reincarnationStepUpdate.now) — the two writes are ordered (this one
// always happens first), but the sweep's two staleness clocks should never
// look out of order relative to each other for the same step just because
// of which write physically landed first.
//
// maxAttempts retries a CAS ERROR — a transient DB failure — up to
// maxAttempts times (design §3.4 Amendment A8.2): reincarnationStepMaxAttempts
// for a step transition, reincarnationStepMaxAttempts+3 for completion or
// failure, matching updateReincarnationStep's convention. A CLEAN loss of
// the race (ok=false, err=nil) is never retried — retrying it would just
// observe the same lost race again. Each retry waits a short backoff first
// (design §3.4 Amendment A9.4, reincarnationRetryBackoff), respecting ctx.
//
// After a retry that ITSELF returns (false, nil), the record is re-read once
// to disambiguate two situations that look identical from the CAS return
// value alone: "someone else owns it now" vs. "an earlier attempt's write
// actually landed, and only the error reporting that back was lost" (a
// network timeout after commit, for example). State==newState alone is NOT
// sufficient proof of the second case (design §3.4 Amendment A9.1): when
// newState is "failed", the replica-safe sweep can ALSO have written
// "failed" to this exact record in between attempts, and State=="failed"
// then holds for both this call's own (never-landed) earlier attempt AND
// the sweep's write — the two are indistinguishable by state alone. Instead,
// every attempt's UpdatedAt is truncated to microsecond precision and
// recorded before it is sent; the re-read is treated as this call's own only
// if State==newState AND UpdatedAt exactly matches one of those recorded
// stamps — a value only this call could have produced, since it is derived
// from this call's own clock reads.
//
// The three-way result distinguishes two very different outcomes a caller
// must not confuse (design §3.4 Amendment A7):
//   - (ok=false, err=nil): a clean loss of the CAS race — this worker no
//     longer owns the record (something else, most likely the replica-safe
//     sweep, already moved it). The caller MUST return immediately without
//     writing the agent row, and must NOT treat this as a failure to report.
//   - (ok=false, err!=nil): a persistent CAS error, after retrying.
//     Silently swallowing this (as an earlier round did, by treating every
//     error the same as losing the race) can leave the agent stuck
//     mid-transition with no worker left to retry it and nothing for the
//     replica-safe sweep to see as non-terminal-but-stale on the RECORD side
//     (it still has a stale agent-state backstop, but that takes the full
//     30-minute bound). A step-transition caller must run the normal
//     failure path instead of returning silently; a completion-transition
//     caller must not, since the agent is already running gen N+1 and
//     failing would restore the wrong config onto it (see

// sections (cmd/reincarnate.go's reincarnateHandoffTemplateText), rather than
// §3.9's literal "Next action"/"Do not redo" labels — "Next action" is a
// sub-field of "Immediate active work (status, next action)" in the

// requester is pre-resolved by buildReincarnationRequesterContext (Amendment
// A26.1, A26.2 R1) — this function does no store I/O itself and stays a pure

//   - Self-request (requester.IsSelf): the header says "reincarnated at its
//     own request" and step 3 points at the handoff's own "Authority and
//     ownership" section rather than naming the agent itself (A26.2 R1: a
//     self-migration must never be told to message its own handle). If
//     agent.CreatedBy resolved to a *different* handle, it's added as its
//     own sentence, a hint for when the handoff names no owner.
//   - Resolved (requester.Resolved): the header names requester.Handle
//     ("reincarnated on request of %s") and step 3 addresses it directly.
//   - Unresolved (neither of the above): the header's "on request of" clause
//     is omitted entirely (Amendment A26.2 O2 — a generic phrase there reads
//     as a tautology), while step 3 keeps reincarnationRequesterFallback,
//     since a next action ("message someone") is still better than none.
//
// plan is the request handler's already-computed ReincarnationPlan (Amendment
// A26.4 O1: passed in by runReincarnationWorker rather than recomputed here,
// so this is exactly what the requester saw in the 202 response, by
// construction). nil omits the line entirely — see reincarnationChangesLine,
// defined below this function. A "Changes: template A->B, image X->Y,
// harness-config P->Q" line is rendered right after the header, naming only
// the fields that actually changed, with hash-valued fields abbreviated to
// `sha256:` plus 12 hex in this preamble line only (Amendment A26.4 O2) —
// the dry-run CLI output is unaffected and still shows the full hash. §3.9
// also has a second header line naming the migration time, which is
// declined here as redundant with step 2's stated window start.
//
// migrationStart is step 2's catch-up window start (design §3.7, Amendment
// A25): only the start is named, not an end — an end timestamp would have to
// be the instant reincarnation_state clears, which isn't known until the
// completion write, long after this preamble is built, so any value written
// here would understate the window. "Since {start}" makes no claim about
// when the window closes. The command given is runnable as written:
// `scion conversation catch-up` takes a `--since <duration>` flag, not
// absolute timestamps, so step 2 asks the agent to choose a duration
// reaching back to the stated instant. Plain `scion conversation list`'s
// output truncates IDs to 12 runes with no `conv:` prefix, which `catch-up`
// cannot accept (it only takes `conv:<full-uuid>`, `@name` or `#name`), so
// step 2 says `list --json` (full untruncated IDs) and spells out the
// `conv:<id>` prefix explicitly.
//
// The redelivery-adjacent wording ("messages ... can be read with
// catch-up") was dropped in Phase 1 (A11.4) because it was false then —
// catch-up did not work inside agent containers and a message sent during
// the gap was rejected or silently dropped, not saved. Phase 2a's F4 fix
// (agent-mode hub-context detection) and migration gate (every hub delivery
// path persists-and-defers instead of rejecting/dropping while
// agents.reincarnation_state is non-terminal) make it true again, so it

// bumping its record's updated_at faster than the bound (tryAdvanceReincarnation
// runs on every step, not just at completion/failure), on whichever replica
// is actually running it, and every write tryAdvanceReincarnation guards
// aborts rather than resurrecting a record the sweep already failed.

// is honest about what happened (the hub does not know how far the worker
// got) and unblocks the agent for a fresh `scion reincarnate` retry.
