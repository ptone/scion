//   - degraded when at least agentErrorDegradedRatio of the considered

// null, broker list not reported) adds a warning item and does not change
// the status. A stale hub instance is outside the fleet rule: it adds a
// warning for hubInstanceStoppedReportingWindow after its last write and
// does not change the status. A stopped hub instance adds nothing.
// Stalled agents are never counted. Offline agents, and error or crashed
// agents below the ratio, add warning items only.

// critical only when the fleet status is unhealthy, otherwise warnings.

// is reporting" or "Hub instance data not available"), hub check items
