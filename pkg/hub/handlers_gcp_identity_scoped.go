// Top-level, scope-addressed GCP service account routes (P4 item C).
//
// /api/v1/projects/{id}/gcp-service-accounts can only ever name one project's
// accounts, which was sufficient while a project was the only thing an account
// could belong to. Hub-scoped accounts have no project to be nested under, so
// they need a route that takes the scope as a parameter instead of encoding it
// in the path. The nested routes stay exactly as they are: they remain the
// natural address for a project's own accounts and every existing client uses
// them.
//
// The API contract here is sa-arch's, binding on P4 and P5:
//   - flat /api/v1/gcp-service-accounts, param spelled scopeId
//   - hub scope is the value "hub", matching store.ScopeHub. It is deliberately
//     NOT normalised to "global" to match TemplateScopeGlobal -- the two
//     vocabularies stay distinct rather than being papered over here
//   - scopeId is omitted on hub scope and resolved by the server

// gcpScopeRequest is a parsed and validated scope selector from the query
// string.

// silently repaired -- default the scope, ignore the stray parameter, overwrite
// the client's scopeId -- and each repair would turn a caller's mistake into a

// address /api/v1/projects/{pid}/gcp-service-accounts/{id} can only reach one
// by borrowing an unrelated project's ID -- which works today only because
// ReachableFromProject returns true from everywhere for hub scope. A UI
// rendering a hub-level account detail page would have to invent a project to
// name it with, and a CLI outside any project could not name it at all.
//
// IT NEEDS LESS AUTHORIZATION THAN THE NESTED ROUTE, NOT MORE (sa-arch).
// authorizeGCPServiceAccount takes no project coordinate: it switches on the
// account's own scope. The project ID in the nested path feeds only
// ReachableFromProject, which is a ROUTING check -- "may this account be
// addressed from here" -- not a permission one. Dropping the project from the
// address therefore drops a routing question that has no answer for a
// parentless account, and leaves the authorization exactly as it was.
//
// No POST to a member and no mint. Creation is the flat COLLECTION's business
// (and hub-scoped creation is still refused there), and mint is a per-project
// quota operation with no meaning at hub scope.
//
// Both fall out of the dispatch below as a 405 with no store lookup at all,
// including /api/v1/gcp-service-accounts/mint -- "mint" parses as an account
// ID, not as the collection-level action the NESTED dispatcher makes it. That
