// beginStartDispatch prepares a start-type dispatch (start, restart, resume,
// DM wake) of agent so that its max_agents_per_broker reservation is held for
// the whole dispatch leg (ptone/scion#2014). Contract:
//
//  1. It reserves agent's broker slot with the cap check
//     (checkAndReserveBrokerQuota; idempotent, so an agent that already holds
//     a reservation keeps it, however old). On a reservation error it returns
//     that error (store.ErrQuotaExceeded, ErrQuotaLockContention, ...) and
//     changes nothing.
//  2. If agent.Phase (the caller's copy) is not counted toward the cap
//     (isBrokerQuotaCountedPhase: stopped, suspended, error), it writes
//     PhaseStarting with UpdateAgentStatus conditional on the stored phase
//     still being agent.Phase (IfPhase), so the quota reconcile
//     (ReconcileStaleBrokerQuotaReservations) sees a counted phase for as
//     long as the dispatch runs and does not release the slot, whatever the
//     reservation's age. The write does not go through
//     reconcileBrokerQuotaOnPhaseChange, which would reserve a second time.
//     An agent already in a counted phase is left as it is. If the write
//     fails, including when the stored phase has moved on from the caller's
//     stale copy (store.ErrPhaseMismatch), a reservation this call created is
//     released, nothing is dispatched, and an error wrapping
//     errStartingWrite is returned. If the mismatch is because a delete now
//     holds the row (or soft-deleted it), the error also wraps
//     store.ErrDeleteInProgress, so callers answer delete_in_progress
//     (deleteClaimedDuringDispatch) as for a refused running intent. A claim
//     on the unchanged row is not a mismatch: the store's delete guard drops
//     the phase, and the caller's running-intent write is then refused
//     (delete_in_progress). marked (wroteStarting) therefore records an
//     attempted write, not an applied one.
//  3. It does NOT change agent.Phase in memory. DispatchAgentStart reads its
//     revoke-on-failure decision (isConfirmedNonRunningPhase) from the
//     in-memory phase, so that decision stays the one the pre-dispatch phase
//     gives. Contrast reincarnate_worker.go, which persists and passes
//     "starting" and so gives up revoke-on-failure.
//
// The caller then dispatches and must, exactly once, either call rollback on
// a dispatch failure (or any early return after this call), or call settle
// once the dispatch has succeeded or the caller has recorded its own failure
// state. Further:
//
//   - The caller's final write must move the row off PhaseStarting. When
//     wroteStarting reports true it should use
//     AgentStatusUpdate.ClearTerminalRemnants (or, for a full-row write,
//     clear the message, stalled marker and exit fields in memory): the
//     store's stopped/error -> running clear no longer fires once the row
//     reads starting.
//   - Clear while the lifecycle op is still held and before the new
//     generation can post its own status: the wake clears on its
//     post-dispatch starting write, before the readiness wait. HTTP start
//     and restart clear on their final write; a status the new container
//     posts between the broker's reply and that write is cleared too (a
//     narrow residual window, accepted).
//   - settle only marks the handle. If the final write fails, the row stays
//     starting with the reservation held, and only a heartbeat corrects it.
//   - A restart re-asserts its reservation twice, without the cap check: the
//     dying container's own status report (phase stopped, through the agent
//     status endpoint, not the heartbeat) releases the slot while the stop
//     leg runs, and the guard below does not cover that path. It calls
//     reassertReservation after the stop leg, and reassertBrokerReservation
//     again after its final write, for a report (a late POST, or a
//     heartbeat on another replica) that lands during the start leg. A
//     report after the final write heals itself: the next running heartbeat
//     re-reserves on stopped -> running (best-effort, with the cap check; at
//     the cap the hourly backfill records it).
//   - rollback restores priorPhase with one conditional write (IfPhase
//     starting), so a phase written meanwhile (a heartbeat from another
//     replica, a launch reaper) is kept. Under a live delete claim the
//     restore is dropped by the store's delete guard; the claim moved the
//     row to stopping, and the delete engine's rollback restores stopped for
//     a prior of starting with no start in flight.
//   - rollback releases the reservation by agent ID when this call created
//     it, which also drops it for a concurrent start of the same agent that
//     reused it (pre-existing behaviour of rollbackBrokerQuota).
//
// The caller must hold a lifecycle op (beginLifecycleOp) for agent from
// before this call until its final status write, or until rollback.
// heartbeatPhaseGuarded uses it to keep a heartbeat that reports the old,
// exited container (stopped, suspended or error) from overwriting
// PhaseStarting and releasing the slot mid-dispatch. That guard is a
// best-effort hint on this replica only: the age gate in the reconcile
// (reconcileMinReservationAge) is the backstop.
