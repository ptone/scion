// ExecuteAgentKeys (task 2.2, ptone/scion#2196) is the sole authoritative
// implementation of the agent-keys operation, consumed by both public route
// shapes (handlers_agents_core.go's handleAgentAction and
// handlers_projects_core.go's handleProjectAgentAction). It replaces task
// 2.1's temporary routing seam wholesale, per the design-owner ruling
// recorded on ptone/scion#2195 and restated as this task's binding
// integration obligation on ptone/scion#2196:
//
//	ValidateBody -> mint one real operation ID -> preserve 2.1's
//	ordering/resolution behavior -> authorizeAgentKeys -> remaining
//	admission/dispatch
//
// so every outcome from validation onward -- not_found, keys_denied, both
// 422s, both 409s, 429, 503, 502/504, the internal 500, and 200 -- carries
// that operation ID (contract §2.5, §3 invariant 3).
//
// Two outcomes are written by this file without an operation ID:
// OutcomeInvalidRequest and OutcomePayloadTooLarge, both decided by
// beginAgentKeysRequest during validation itself, before an operation is
// recognized to exist. Two more no-ID cases are decided before this file
// ever runs, by shared code upstream of it: OutcomeUnauthorized (the shared
// auth middleware answers an unauthenticated request before any handler
// runs) and the project-scoped route's own shared project-resolution 404
// (handleProjectAgents, decided before dispatching to any action-specific
// code, including this one; this one is not an agentkeys.Outcome value at
// all).
//
// Full execution order (ptone/scion#2184's execution order, restated in
// .design/agent-keys-contract.md §2.5):
//
//	authenticate (middleware, outside this file)
//	  -> bounded strict decode (beginAgentKeysRequest)
//	  -> mint operation ID (beginAgentKeysRequest)
//	  -> resolve target/project, preserving 2.1's per-route ordering
//	     (handleAgentActionKeysTopLevel / handleAgentActionKeysProjectScoped)
//	  -> authorizeAgentKeys (task 2.1, unchanged)
//	  -> charge keys budget (admitAndDispatchAgentKeys)
//	  -> check running phase, runtime support and immediate broker route
//	     (admitAndDispatchAgentKeys)
//	  -> write admission audit
//	  -> one typed dispatch (agentkeys.Dispatcher, task 1.2)
//	  -> outcome audit and response
//
// No conversation resolver, message store, observer, mention parser,
// notification subscription, message-status callback or managed
// CreateInteraction call is reachable from this file (contract §4.4): a
// keys request never enters the messaging call graph at any outcome.
