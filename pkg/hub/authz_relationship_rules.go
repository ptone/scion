// Relationship candidates (ptone/scion#2119).
//
// A named relationship (owner, ancestor, progeny, hub-member service-account
// assign) produces a typed candidate for the requested permission. Every
// candidate passes the same ordered stages before it may grant anything:
//
//  1. relationship_policy  — the permission is listed for the relationship,
//     principal kind and resource type in permissions.RelationshipPolicies;
//  2. untrusted_ancestry   — a relationship derived from the ancestry chain
//     requires hub-attested ancestry, for every principal kind;
//     2b. execution_project — an agent's progeny read requires its source
//     user's live admission to the agent's project;
//     2c. project_access — a local user's owner or ancestor relationship on
//     a project-scoped target requires the user's active access to that
//     project (Decide only, for interactive and UAT requests; not the
//     delegation-ceiling walk; see relationshipProjectAccessStage);
//  3. relationship_fact    — the rule's store fact holds (hub membership, a
//     progeny sharing source); a lookup failure rejects the candidate;
//  4. source_inactive      — the sharing source's owner is still active;
//  5. the request's restrictions (credential scope, agent token scope,
//     access constraints) — the same slice the kernel applied.
//
// The first accepted candidate becomes the decision. Every evaluated
// candidate is recorded in DecisionProvenance.Relationships when the
// request asks for an explanation.
