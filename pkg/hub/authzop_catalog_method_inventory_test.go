const bogusSegment = "live-inventory-bogus-suffix"

// TestCatalogHTTPEntryPoints_LiveMethodCheck probes the real server mux for
// every declared HTTP entry point in authzop.Catalog (skipping the reviewed
// exclusion maps above) and makes three assertions per entry:
//
//  1. Positive check: sending the catalog's declared method at a path built
//     from the declared pattern, with real fixture IDs substituted wherever
//     the live handler needs one to exist, must not return 404 or 405.
//  2. Control check (runs first — see the ordering note below): sending an
//     unsupported method (bogusMethod) at the same path must return 405.
//     This proves the positive check actually reached the handler's method
//     dispatch — without it, a handler that 404s or errors before ever
//     looking at r.Method would make the positive check pass vacuously
//     regardless of what method the catalog declares.
//  3. Suffix check: sending the declared method at path + "/" + bogusSegment
//     must return 404 or 405. This catches a pattern that is missing a
//     trailing segment a live route actually requires (declared too short),
//     as opposed to declaring the wrong segment (caught by check 1, since a
//     substituted-but-wrong segment reaches a different, real 404). It runs
//     for every entry, parameterised or not: a static collection route can
//     share a mux prefix with a by-ID route, so a missing segment is just as
//     meaningful a question for it.
//
// What these three checks together prove: for an entry not excluded from
// any of them, the catalog's declared method is the one the live route
// accepts, and the declared pattern (with its parameters substituted) is
// long enough to reach that route's own dispatch rather than a shorter
// prefix's. That is #2227's AC2 for the shape of drift the original catalog
// actually had — a wrong method, or a wrong/incomplete path segment.
//
// What these checks do NOT prove, even for an included entry:
//   - That the pattern is not too LONG. A handler that ignores or discards
//     an extra trailing segment returns the same result as it does for the
//     bare path, so the positive check cannot tell a too-long pattern from
//     a correct one. Such a handler also FAILS the suffix check (it
//     answers something other than 404/405), which is why it is listed in
//     suffixCheckExclusions with the specific reason: e.g. handleUserByID
//     falls through for any unrecognized suffix; extractID-based handlers
//     truncate at the first '/' and discard the rest rather than folding
//     it into the ID. This is a real, named limitation, not an oversight.
//   - Full path correctness when the positive check's non-404/405 status
//     comes from a pre-dispatch condition unrelated to routing — most
//     commonly a 5xx or 503 for a backend this test server does not
//     configure (the secret backend, the metrics/telemetry project,
//     attachment storage), or a body-validation 400 before the path ID is
//     used. For those entries the positive check confirms only that the
//     route and method exist. The control and suffix checks still run
//     unless the entry is excluded from them — several of these are
//     excluded from the suffix check, and gcp.identity.verify from the
//     control check (see the maps above).
