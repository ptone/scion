// scope. That grant is meant to cover the hub-wide catalog only — per the

// resources only."
//
// Left untouched, by construction:
//   - Project-scoped bindings (project-member/owner/admin): already
//     correctly contained by the kernel's scope containment check
//     (scopeApplies), which only applies a project-scoped grant when its
//     ScopeID matches the resource's project.
//   - Elevated system-scoped roles (hub-admin, super-admin): hub admins
//     retain visibility into every skill regardless of scope, per the
//     ptone/scion#1901 ruling ("readable only by the owning user and hub
//     admins").
//   - The resource-owner relationship grant (checkRelationshipGrants),
//     evaluated separately after the kernel: an owner keeps access to their
//     own user-scoped skill even once the hub-member grant no longer
//     applies to it here.
//
// skillScope is the skill's own Scope value (store.SkillScope*), taken from
// Resource.ScopeKind. ptone/scion#1901 finding F4: this fails closed. Only
// "global" and "core" are exempt; user, project, an empty string, and any
// future or unrecognized value are all filtered like project/user. Before
// this fix, an ad hoc Resource{Type:"skill"} literal that forgot to set
// ScopeKind (see finding F3, canUseProjectGitHubToken) silently kept the
// curated hub-member/hub-viewer grant in force — exactly the #1901 leak,
// reopened through a different call site. Legitimate create-time checks
// that have no existing skill to read still pass an explicit scope via
// skillScopeResource (never a bare literal), so they are unaffected.
