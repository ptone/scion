// agent of the project starts there (pkg/agent resolveSharedDirs, local
// layout or NFS export), or by the hub on the first file write/upload
// through the shared-dir file routes (openSharedDirRoot with
// createIfMissing). Reads never create it: listing a declared but not yet
// created shared dir answers 200 with an empty list, and reading a file in
// it answers 404.
//
// A hub write only reaches storage the hub itself can resolve
// (resolveSharedDirPath): the NFS export, a hub-managed project's local
// layout on the hub host, or a co-located broker's path for a git project.
// It never creates a remote broker's local copy, which exists only once an
// agent starts on that broker; for a git project with no co-located
// provider and no NFS export a hub write is rejected and creates nothing.
// Creation at agent start is the only path that reaches remote brokers,
// which is why first use, not POST, is the contract on every deployment.
