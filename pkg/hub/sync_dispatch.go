// syncDispatchTimeout bounds one dispatcher call of a synchronous launch
// (create, provision, env finalize, workspace-bootstrap create, start, and
// each leg of a restart) once the launch no longer follows the client's
// request (ptone/scion#1961). One call is one launch attempt, which may make
// several broker requests (a hash-mismatch retry, a second-pass finalize, or
// a cross-node deferred wait); the bound covers them all together.
//
// It equals the hub-to-broker request limit: the control channel's
// RequestTimeout (set in New, server.go:2007; default in
// DefaultControlChannelConfig, controlchannel.go:59) and the
// broker HTTP transport's client timeout (broker_http_transport.go). When it
// fires, the dispatch ctx is done, and what the broker sees depends on the
// transport: on the control channel, BrokerConnection.TunnelRequest sends a
// cancel frame; on direct HTTP, the request is aborted; on a cross-node
// deferred dispatch, nothing is sent, and the owning node runs the durable
// intent to its end. A variable so tests can shorten it.
var syncDispatchTimeout = 120 * time.Second

// hubWorkspaceUploadTimeout bounds the create-time upload of a hub-managed
// project workspace to storage, which runs detached from the client
// (ptone/scion#1961). Generous: a large workspace can take minutes. A
// variable so tests can shorten it.
var hubWorkspaceUploadTimeout = 10 * time.Minute

// detachLaunchFromClient returns a context for the rest of a synchronous
// launch: it keeps ctx's values (identity, trace, dispatch warnings) but not
// its cancellation, so a client that disconnects or times out (the CLI hub
// client gives up after 30s) no longer cancels the broker launch, its
// post-dispatch store writes, or the rollback of a real failure
// (ptone/scion#1961). Each broker call made under it is bounded by
// syncDispatch. The asynchronous launch path does not use it: it already
// returns before the launch finishes.
