// syncDispatchTimeout bounds one dispatcher call of a synchronous launch
// (create, provision, env finalize, workspace-bootstrap create, start, and
// each leg of a restart) once the launch no longer follows the client's
// request (ptone/scion#1961). One call is one launch attempt, which may make
// several broker requests (a hash-mismatch retry, a second-pass finalize, or
// a cross-node deferred wait); the bound covers them all together.
//
// It equals the hub-to-broker request limit: the control channel's
// RequestTimeout (set in New, server.go:2007; default in
// DefaultControlChannelConfig, controlchannel.go:59) and the
// broker HTTP transport's client timeout (broker_http_transport.go). When it
// fires, the dispatch ctx is done, and what the broker sees depends on the
// transport: on the control channel, BrokerConnection.TunnelRequest sends a
// cancel frame; on direct HTTP, the request is aborted; on a cross-node
// deferred dispatch, nothing is sent, and the owning node runs the durable
// intent to its end. A variable so tests can shorten it.

// client gives up after 30s) no longer cancels the broker launch, its
// post-dispatch store writes, or the rollback of a real failure

// wake's resume budget) still bounds it. The direct-message wake uses it

// it is unbounded (0) or already at least the budget, so this never
