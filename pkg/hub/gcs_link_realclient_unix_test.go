// TestGCSLink_RealSource_NoADCDetection proves gcsObjectSourceFor never
// runs ADC (Application Default Credentials) detection. A merely-missing
// or malformed GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS path does not distinguish
// this: the storage client's own ADC detection swallows a read or parse
// error there rather than surfacing it, so client construction would
// succeed either way. Instead, GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS points at a
// FIFO with no writer: a real attempt to read it — the open() call alone,
// before any read — blocks until a writer appears, so the only way this
// test can pass is if nothing ever tries to open that path. The call runs
// in a goroutine racing a bound: if ADC detection is skipped, it returns
// almost immediately; if it ran, it is still blocked when the bound
// expires, and the test fails there without waiting for it to return —
// detection's own retries after the FIFO unblocks are not bounded by
// anything this test controls. The FIFO is still opened read-write
// (which never blocks a FIFO open, regardless of other openers) once the
// bound expires and again at cleanup, so a goroutine stuck in the open()
// call can exit on its own in the background rather than hanging forever.
//
// This test lives in its own unix-tagged file (syscall.Mkfifo has no
// Windows equivalent): only this test and its exclusively-used imports
// move here, so the rest of this package's test suite — including every
// other RealClient test in gcs_link_realclient_test.go that shares
// fakeGCSJSONServer — is unaffected and keeps compiling on every platform.
