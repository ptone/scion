// #48 — the existence oracle on service-account IDs, and the tests that make it
// falsifiable.
//
// A caller who may create agents in their own project names a service account
// by ID. Two ways that can fail: the ID matches no account at all, or it
// matches one that is not reachable from this project. IF THE TWO FAILURES LOOK
// DIFFERENT, the endpoint answers "does this ID exist?" for accounts the caller
// cannot see — and since the caller supplies the ID, they can ask about any ID
// they like, including ones they guessed or harvested from another project's
// logs. Enumeration is then a loop over the difference.
//
// Before #48:
//   - agent create answered "not found" vs "does not belong to this project",
//     same 400, different message;
//   - agent PATCH answered 404 vs 400 — distinguishable without reading the
//     body at all;
//   - project settings collapsed both, correctly, and had done since it was
//     written. It was the standard the other two did not follow.
//
// ⚠️ THESE TESTS ASSERT AN EQUALITY, WHICH IS A SHAPE THAT PASSES TOO EASILY.
// "Two responses are identical" is also true when the handler returns the same
// thing for everything, or when the harness cannot see the difference it is
// asked about. TestSAOracle_TheComparisonCanSeeADifference is the control for
// exactly that and should be read as part of every test here — without it, the
// equalities below are green whether or not the collapse is the reason.

// oracleProbe is one request's observable answer: everything a caller can see.

// requireIndistinguishable compares two answers byte for byte, not by asserting
// that each matches some expected message.
//
// ⚠️ AND THE COLLAPSE TOOK SOMETHING AWAY FROM EVERY OTHER TEST HERE. The
// response no longer says WHICH branch produced the 400. So an assertion of the
// form "seed an unreachable account, expect 400 and this message" is now
// satisfied just as well by a fixture that never persisted the account at all —
// a mistyped ID, a seeding helper whose error was swallowed, a store reset
// between calls. That green used to be impossible to get by accident, because
// nonexistence said something different; it is now the default failure mode of
// a broken fixture.
//
// Two instruments, and they answer different questions:
//
//   - THE COLLAPSE HOLDS: same request, account present-but-unreachable versus
//     absent, answers identical. That is this function.
//   - THE PREDICATE STILL RUNS: the account must be genuinely PRESENT in both
//     arms and only its reachability varied — reachable is admitted, unreachable
//     is refused. Nothing in this file does that, and it is not this file's job.
//     TestBypassAgents_UpdateAgentServiceAccountChecks holds the tightest pair —
//     "another project is rejected" against "verified in-project is still
//     accepted", one fixture, reachability the only variable. Create's is
//     TestAgentCreate_HubScopedSA_AssignableByCreatorAndAdmin against
//     TestAgentCreate_OtherProjectSA_StillRejected. Those admitted arms are what
//     stop the refusals here being vacuous.
//
// Asserting the collapse without the second instrument somewhere is how a
// deleted scope check would pass review: every refusal test still refuses, for
// the wrong reason, and nothing says so.
//
// The property under test is that the two cases are THE SAME ANSWER, and an
// expected-message assertion does not test that: two branches can both contain
// msgSANotAvailableInProject and still differ in status, in error code, or in a
// field added later. Comparing the whole response tests the property directly
// and keeps testing it when the response shape changes — a future field that
// leaks the distinction fails here without anyone having to think of it.
