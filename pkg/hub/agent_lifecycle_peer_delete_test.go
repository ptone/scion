// TestDeleteAgent_SameProjectPeerAllowedWithLifecycleScope pins existing,
// intentional behavior rather than changing it: an agent holding
// project:agent:lifecycle may delete any agent within its own project, not
// only its own descendants. authorizeAgentLifecycle's doc comment calls this
// breadth deliberate (design Q3), and performAgentDelete's AgentIdentity
// branch applies the identical two-part check (scope + same project, no
// ancestry test). This is not part of #1908 -- it is the same rule on both
// the global and project-scoped delete routes, so there is nothing route-
// specific to fix here. The test exists so that if this model changes later
// (tracked separately, see #1097), the change shows up as a diff to an
// explicit assertion instead of silently drifting between the two routes.
