// These tests exercise the per-project routes against an SA that the project
// does NOT own, because that is the case the pre-Goal-2 code could not express:
// the guards compared sa.ScopeID against the project ID and so rejected every
// hub-scoped SA, and the authorization checks hung on the project resource and
// so would have handed a hub-wide credential to whichever project the caller
// happened to be looking at it through.

// newHubScopedSA builds a hub-scoped SA owned by nobody in particular. CreatedBy
// is deliberately a stranger: the owner short-circuit in checkAccessForUser
// would otherwise mask which branch of the authorization actually fired.

// A hub member can read a hub-scoped SA through a project that does not own it.
//
// This asserts an ACCEPTED EXPOSURE, not a designed permission, and the
// distinction is the reason the test exists. seed.go:51 seeds
// hub-member-read-all as ScopeType "hub" / ResourceType "*" / [read, list] /
// allow, bound to the hub-members group that every user joins on login; and
// matchesResource has no case "hub" arm, so a hub-scoped policy falls straight
// through its switch. The consequence is that every authenticated user has
// read+list on every hub-scoped resource, service accounts included. sa-arch
// ruled on 2026-07-28 to accept this rather than carve service accounts out of
// a seeded hub-wide policy, on the grounds that it is read+list only and
// assignment stays gated on ActionAssign + CanActAs.
//
// It is pinned here because it is currently load-bearing — the P5 service
// account picker depends on ordinary members being able to list hub-scoped SAs
// — and because nothing else asserts it. If someone later narrows
// hub-member-read-all, or adds a case "hub" arm to matchesResource, this test
// fails and that consequence becomes visible rather than silent.
//
// Note the inverse test is deliberately ABSENT. Asserting that a project owner
// is DENIED read here would fail today, and the cheapest way to make such a
// test pass would be to give hub-scoped SAs a project parent — which is
// precisely the #595 defect, arrived at through a green test.
