// publishAgentCreatedIfLive publishes agent.created for agent from a re-read
// of its row, unless a delete got there first (ptone/scion#2972).
// createAgent publishes created only after its dispatch returns, and with
// asynchronous launch (ptone/scion#2153) that can be well after a DELETE
// claimed, or even finished with, the row. Publishing then would re-add a
// deleted agent in web clients after its deleted event.
//
// The publish is skipped when:
//   - the row is gone (hard-deleted);
//   - DeletedAt is set (soft-deleted);
//   - a delete claim holds the row: deleteStopNoop, i.e. a live deleting or
//     finalizing lease, or a finalizing row whose lease expired. The
//     expired-finalizing case skips on purpose: teardown and revocation have
//     run, only a retry or force lifts it, and created carries no deletion
//     view, so it would show the agent without its banner.
//
// A failed delete (state failed, or a deleting row whose lease expired) does
// not suppress the publish: the delete gave up and the agent is live.
//
// The fresh row is published rather than agent, as the final createAgent
// publish always did: a concurrent status write (or a guarded store write
// that a racing delete dropped) may have moved it on. If the re-read fails
// for a reason other than not-found, agent is published as before.
//
// Residual window: the re-read and the publish are not atomic with the delete
// engine, so a delete that claims and finishes between them can still emit
// this (unmarked) created after its deleted. Web clients drop an unmarked
// created for an ID they tombstoned on deleted (ptone/scion#2886), which
// covers it there. MessageBrokerProxy.handleLifecycleEvent re-checks the row
// by the same rule before subscribing (createdAgentLive, ptone/scion#3056).
//
// It reports whether the agent is live: false when the publish was skipped
// because the row is gone, soft-deleted or delete-held. A failed re-read
// counts as live, as it publishes. The synchronous create answers 409 on
// false (ptone/scion#3099).
