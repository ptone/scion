// Missing-container reconcile (GoogleCloudPlatform/scion#2077).
//
// A runtime broker's heartbeat lists the agents its runtimes report, that is,
// the containers (or Kubernetes pods) that exist. When a container disappears
// outside of a Scion lifecycle action (a node drain, repair or eviction
// removing a pod, or a container removed by hand), the agent would otherwise
// stay in phase running forever. The heartbeat reports, per runtime target
// (the broker's default runtime and each auxiliary runtime; a Kubernetes
// target is identified by cluster context and namespace), whether that
// target was listed completely, and each reported agent carries the target
// that listed it. The Hub records that target on the agent. After every
// heartbeat, the Hub looks for agents assigned to the broker that are in
// phase running, whose recorded target this heartbeat lists as complete, but
// which are absent from the report. Once such an agent has been continuously
// absent for the grace period it is moved to phase error with exit reason
// container_missing (an existing preempted or evicted exit reason is kept).
//
// The mechanism is runtime-neutral: it applies to Docker, Podman, Apple
// container and Kubernetes brokers alike, because it only compares the
// heartbeat's inventory with the Hub's agent rows.
//
// Safety rules (each one keeps a live agent from being caught):
//   - Only an agent whose recorded runtime target is listed as complete in
//     this heartbeat is considered. A target is complete only when its
//     listing succeeded, so a forbidden or failed listing (for example a
//     Kubernetes namespace the broker may not read) never leads to a
//     conclusion about its agents, while other targets are still reconciled.
//   - An agent with no recorded target, or whose target is absent from the
//     heartbeat, is never concluded. The recorded target (and any candidate)
//     is cleared, with a state_version bump, whenever a create, start or
//     restart is accepted, so an agent started anew is only considered after
//     two consecutive heartbeats have listed it on the same target again, and
//     a writer holding a read from before the clear cannot write the old
//     target back. An older broker sends no targets, and a filtered
//     (multi-hub) heartbeat claims none.
//   - The broker must be online and its previous heartbeat must be recent; a
//     broker returning from an offline or stale period restarts every clock.
//   - Only phase running is considered. created/provisioning/cloning/starting
//     are dispatch phases in which the container may legitimately not exist
//     yet; suspended/stopping/stopped/error are not running.
//   - Agents with a reincarnation, a queued lifecycle dispatch, or a lifecycle
//     dispatch in flight on this Hub are skipped.
//   - The agent must be absent from complete inventories for the whole grace
//     period, as observed by this Hub process, AND its last_seen (bumped by
//     every heartbeat that reports it and by the agent's own status reports)
//     must be older than the grace period. last_seen, not the row's updated
//     timestamp, is used because unrelated writes bump updated.
//   - The final write is a single conditional UPDATE whose WHERE clause
//     re-checks deleted_at, broker, phase, reincarnation state and last_seen.

// DefaultMissingAgentGrace is the default time an agent must be continuously
// absent from its broker's complete heartbeat inventory before the Hub marks
// it as having no container. At the default 30s broker heartbeat interval this
