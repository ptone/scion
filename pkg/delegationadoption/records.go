// marker. The pass runs once per version, not on every start.
//
// Version 1: before it, the write guard compared the edge's updated time as
// stored text, so on SQLite a row whose stored timestamp text was not in

// were recorded skipped_changed/edge_changed, and their descendants
// skipped_changed/ancestor_not_adopted.

// with every rule ApplyAdopt applies, so a hop that really changed is
