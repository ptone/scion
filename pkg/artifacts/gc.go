// INVARIANT: every digest referenced by a ready, pending or finalizing
// version of a live artifact is readable from blob storage, at every point
// of any interleaving of writes, marks and sweeps, including deletes that
// time out and still reach the object store later.
//
// Why it holds. The rules, each enforced in one place:
//
//  R1. References are the files of every pending, finalizing or ready
//      version of a non-deleted artifact, whether or not their bytes have
//      arrived (blobReferencedFrom). A blob is deleted only when, under its
//      state row's lock (reclaimOne), it has been marked unreferenced since
//      before the grace period, has not been touched since before it, and
//      still has no reference.
//  R2. Every write of bytes goes through storeBlob: it touches the blob
//      (waiting for a sweep holding the row) and then always uploads,
//      overwriting any existing object. No write relies on an object that
//      is already there.
//  R3. A delete on a provider that versions objects names the generation
//      the sweep listed (DeleteIfGeneration); a provider without versions
//      deletes synchronously. A versioned provider without a known
//      generation gets no delete.
//
// The paths that create a reference:
//
//   - Single-file publish, PUT of a pending file, fetched remote images at
//     finalize: storeBlob (R2) before the reference is recorded. The touch
//     keeps the sweep off the blob for the grace period (R1), longer than
//     the request; the upload's new generation outlives any delete issued
//     before it (R3).
//   - Two-step create or append: its manifest rows are references from the
//     moment they are written (R1), before any upload; the upload then goes
//     through storeBlob.
//   - Carry-forward (a file identical to the current version's needs no
//     upload): its digest is already referenced by the current version,
//     continuously since that version's own write (R1, R2), so no delete
//     can have been decided for it since; a delete issued before that write
//     names an older generation (R3).
//
// Unchanged files still share one stored object: a digest has one object
// path, which writes overwrite. TestBlobGCInterleavings checks the
// invariant over random sequences; the deterministic tests pin each path.
//
// Blob garbage collection (design §6). A soft-deleted artifact is not a
// reference; the grace period is its undo window. Abandoned pending
// versions should be reaped (ReapPending) before a sweep, so their files
// stop counting.

// one (storeBlob always uploads). A missing object or a changed generation
// counts as done: the bytes the sweep meant to delete are gone or were
