// Credential returns the credential for a privilege drop to uid/gid that
// keeps the runtime-granted nfs shared-dir groups (FromEnv). Groups is
// never nil: an empty, non-nil slice states explicitly that every other
// supplementary group is cleared, which is what Go does for nil as well.
// Use it at every site where sciontool drops to the agent user, so a hook
// or service writing into a shared dir behaves like the harness. The
// init-time git commands (configureGitCommand in cmd/sciontool/commands/init.go)
// and the rootless keep-id early drop (setupHostUser in the same file)
// deliberately do not use it, because they run before shared dirs are used.
