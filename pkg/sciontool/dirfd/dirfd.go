// Package dirfd resolves a path into an open directory file descriptor by
// walking every path component with openat(2), so that a symlink swapped
// into ANY component of the path — not just the final one — is refused
// instead of followed.
//
// A plain O_NOFOLLOW on the final os.OpenFile call only protects the leaf:
// if an intermediate directory such as $HOME/.scion is itself replaced with
// a symlink (something a process that owns $HOME can always do), the
// kernel still resolves and follows that symlink while walking the rest of
// the path, because O_NOFOLLOW only applies to the last component. A
// process that runs as root for its whole life over a directory tree a
// less-privileged user owns (the sciontool init/substrate-serve pattern)
// needs every component checked, not just the last one.
//
// Callers get back an open fd for path's parent directory and path's own
// leaf name, and are expected to do every remaining operation — create,
// open, rename, chown — through the *at() syscalls relative to that fd,
// never through another path-based call, so nothing after the walk can be
// redirected by a symlink swapped in afterwards.

// followed. The caller owns the returned fd and must close it.
//
// path must be absolute (or resolvable via filepath.Abs against the
// current working directory); it does not need to exist yet — only its
