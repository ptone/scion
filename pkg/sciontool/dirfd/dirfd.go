// Package dirfd resolves a path into an open directory file descriptor by
// walking every path component with openat(2), so that a symlink swapped
// into ANY component of the path — not just the final one — is refused
// instead of followed.
//
// A plain O_NOFOLLOW on the final os.OpenFile call only protects the leaf:
// if an intermediate directory such as $HOME/.scion is itself replaced with
// a symlink (something a process that owns $HOME can always do), the
// kernel still resolves and follows that symlink while walking the rest of
// the path, because O_NOFOLLOW only applies to the last component. A
// process that runs as root for its whole life over a directory tree a
// less-privileged user owns (the sciontool init/substrate-serve pattern)
// needs every component checked, not just the last one.
//
// Callers get back an open fd for path's parent directory and path's own
// leaf name, and are expected to do every remaining operation — create,
// open, rename, chown — through the *at() syscalls relative to that fd,
// never through another path-based call, so nothing after the walk can be
// redirected by a symlink swapped in afterwards.

// EnsureDirNoFollowUnderRoot ensures that path exists as a directory,

// ".."-relative escape, a sibling that merely shares root's own string
// prefix, or anything relUnderRoot cannot express as a descendant of root —
// so a caller with a legitimate reason to create a directory outside root
// (e.g. an operator-configured absolute path) can fall back to its own
// handling for that case. path EQUAL to root itself is reported as
// underRoot=true: root is trivially "under" itself, the same way a file
// directly inside $HOME (dir == $HOME) is a legitimate under-home target,
// not an escape. relUnderRoot's own rel=="." refusal exists for a different
// caller (ReadUnderRootNoFollow, where reading root itself as a leaf file
// makes no sense) and says nothing about this case, so it is checked before
// ever calling relUnderRoot.
//
// When path DOES resolve under root, this walks from root (opened once via
// EnsureDirTrustedAncestorFollow, so a trusted symlink at root's own leaf or
// any of root's own ancestors is followed rather than refused — see that
// function's own doc comment) down to path one component at a time, exactly
// like OpenParentNoFollow's walk: each component is opened with
// O_DIRECTORY|O_NOFOLLOW relative to the previous component's own already-
// open fd, never by re-parsing a path string. A missing component is
// created with mkdirat (so nothing can be planted there as a side effect of
// the create itself) and then reopened no-follow; a component that already
// exists as a symlink or as any non-directory is refused before anything —
// including a chown — happens to it. Only a component this call itself
// creates is chowned (fchown on that component's own open fd, never a
// path-based os.Chown) to uid:gid, when uid > 0; a pre-existing component's
// ownership is left exactly as it was. mode is the permission bits used for
// any component this call creates.
//
// This is what closes the gap a path-based os.MkdirAll + os.Chown leaves
// open for a directory chain under a directory the WORKLOAD controls (e.g.
// $HOME): os.MkdirAll silently succeeds when a component is a symlink to an
// existing directory, and a subsequent os.Chown follows it — so a workload
// that plants, say, $HOME/.scion -> /etc ahead of a restart can have root
// chown /etc to the workload's own uid before this package's own leaf-write
// guards ever run. Once every component is confirmed real and either
// pre-existing (untouched) or freshly created (owned by uid:gid), there is
// nothing left along the chain for a symlink swap to redirect.
//
// On success, dirFd is an open, symlink-safe O_DIRECTORY fd for path
// itself: the caller writes its own leaf through this SAME fd (e.g. via
// WriteAtNoFollowWithChown), never by re-resolving path as a string again —
// which matters here specifically because root may have been reached
// through a trusted symlink EnsureDirTrustedAncestorFollow followed, and a
// fresh path-based walk (OpenParentNoFollow's strict no-follow) would
// refuse that same symlink the second time around. The caller owns dirFd
// and must close it; dirFd is -1 whenever err is non-nil or underRoot is
