//
// Callers running in a root context are expected to treat this the way

// already-open fd — never by re-parsing a path string — with
// O_DIRECTORY|O_NOFOLLOW, before the final component is read via
// ReadAtNoFollow's own O_NOFOLLOW|O_NONBLOCK open and bounded read.
//
// Containment is checked by walking, not by comparing path strings, which a
// string-prefix or filepath.Rel check alone cannot make symlink-safe: a
// symlink whose own *name* sits inside root but whose target does not
// (root/link -> /etc/shadow) must be refused even though the string form
// "root/link" passes any textual containment check. relUnderRoot's job is
// only to turn path into the list of component names this function walks;
// every actual safety guarantee comes from resolving each of those names
// against an fd already anchored inside root, with no step that ever looks
// a name up starting from "/" again.
//
// Unlike a bare O_NOFOLLOW walk, a symlink encountered at ANY component —
// intermediate or leaf — is not refused outright: this function follows it
// exactly as far as it can prove, by continuing the same fd-anchored walk,
// that the target stays under root. When the no-follow open of a component
// fails, isSymlinkAt fstats that exact name (AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW, against
// the same dirFd, so still no path re-lookup) to tell "this failed because
// it's a symlink" apart from every other reason an open can fail — the two
// look identical in errno terms for an intermediate component: an
// O_DIRECTORY|O_NOFOLLOW open of a symlink fails ENOTDIR on Linux, the same
// code a plain file in that position would also produce, not the ELOOP a
// non-O_DIRECTORY open of a symlink gives. Only a confirmed symlink is
// resolved; every other failure (missing, wrong type, permission) is
// returned as-is. Once confirmed, the target is read with unix.Readlinkat
// against the fd this walk already holds for its containing directory —
// never os.Readlink or filepath.EvalSymlinks, both of which re-parse a path
// string from scratch, reopening the TOCTOU window a workload that owns the
// directory could use to swap an ancestor between the read and the reopen —
// and its components are spliced in front of the remaining path and walked
// the same way. An absolute target, or one containing "..", is refused
// (ErrPathEscapesRoot): this walk has no way to prove either stays under
// root without trusting the target's own text, which is exactly what it
// must not do. A chain longer than maxSymlinkResolutionsUnderRoot hops is
// refused (ErrTooManySymlinksUnderRoot) rather than followed forever.
//
// This is what makes a real Kubernetes projected-secret volume readable:
// kubelet lays each key out as "key" -> "..data/key", and "..data" itself
// as a symlink to a timestamped directory holding the actual files — two
// ordinary, root-relative symlink hops that never leave the volume's own
// directory, which a blanket symlink refusal broke unconditionally.
//
// There is no separate stat anywhere in this path beyond what resolving a
