// trustedChainModeBits are the permission bits chainIsTrusted refuses on any

// (e.g. a hardened "/tmp") resistant to one workload renaming or unlinking
// another workload's entries — it does nothing to stop a workload from
// creating a brand new entry there in the first place, which is all the
// directories this check protects need to resist.

// as the workload identity and there is no separate root/workload boundary
// to protect at all) — owned by selfUID, the caller's own effective uid.
// Either way, it must carry neither the group- nor the other-write bit.
//
// It says nothing about any OTHER component in the chain — callers combine
// every component's result themselves by requiring it of all of them. Kept
// as a pure function of already-fetched values (not one that stats anything
// itself), so it can be exercised by a test with fabricated ownership/mode
