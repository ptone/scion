// follow that symlink instead of refusing it. Production always leaves this
// at its zero value (root): only a root-owned link sitting in a root-owned,
// group/other-non-writable directory is a system-configured alias (e.g.
// "/var/run" -> "/run", "/home" -> "/var/home") that no workload can plant
// or redirect — nobody but root could have created or replaced it. A test
// overrides this to the test process's own real uid (mirroring the
// startReaper/runSetupHostUser seam pattern elsewhere in this codebase), so
// the trust check can be exercised end to end without CAP_CHOWN or running
// the test suite as root.
//
// This is deliberately simpler than rootowned.go's chainIsTrusted, which
// also accepts a caller's own effective uid as an alternative to uid 0 (for
// a rootless/keep-id deployment with no separate root/workload boundary).
// EnsureDirTrustedAncestorFollow runs on the staged-secrets write path,
// which only ever matters when sciontool init is root-context to begin
// with (os.Getuid() == 0 is Write's own gate before uid/gid are even
// resolved) — there is no rootless caller of this specific walk to
// accommodate, so the single fixed trusted uid is the simpler, narrower

// this walk's own motivating bug (a staged file secret whose target has a
// symlinked system ancestor) drives it indirectly, through
// pkg/stagedsecrets.Write — a different package, which cannot reach an
// unexported var here directly. A test creates its fixture symlinks owned

// EnsureDirTrustedAncestorFollow resolves path's full directory chain from
// "/" down, component by component, exactly like EnsureDirNoFollowUnderRoot
// and OpenParentNoFollow do (openat(2) with O_DIRECTORY|O_NOFOLLOW against
// each previous component's own already-open fd, never by re-parsing a path
// string) — except that a symlink at any component is not unconditionally
// refused. It is followed if, and only if, BOTH hold:
//
//   - the symlink's own directory entry is owned by trustedAncestorOwnerUID
//     (checked via Fstatat with AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW — a Lstat-equivalent
//     that never dereferences the link itself); and
//   - the directory CONTAINING that symlink is also owned by
//     trustedAncestorOwnerUID and carries neither the group- nor the
//     other-write bit.
//
// Any symlink that fails either check is refused with an error naming the
// component, and nothing past it — on either side of the refused link — is
// ever opened, created, or chowned: the function returns immediately, so a
// caller can rely on nothing further having been written to the
// filesystem the instant this returns a non-nil error.
//
// A missing component (ENOENT) is created with mkdirat — 0755, never
// chowned to any uid, since every directory this call creates sits on a
// root-controlled system path, not workload territory — then reopened
// O_NOFOLLOW to continue the walk. This is what lets this function replace
// a path-based os.MkdirAll for an operator-configured destination outside
// any workload-controlled directory: like os.MkdirAll, missing ancestors
// are created; unlike it, a symlink swapped into the chain is never
// silently followed except where the trust check above explicitly allows
// it.
//
// This is NOT a general "resolve any symlink" helper. filepath.EvalSymlinks
// would follow a WORKLOAD-plantable ancestor too — a secret Target under a
// workload-writable directory with a symlinked component redirecting into,
// say, /etc — letting root create or truncate-in-place a file in a
// directory the workload chose instead of the operator. That is exactly
// the class of hole this package's no-follow walks exist to close. Trust
// here is decided per-component, by ownership and writability of both the
// link and its containing directory, never by "the kernel resolved it"
// alone.
//
// A symlink target is spliced into the walk and continues from "/" if
// absolute, or from the symlink's own containing directory if relative —
// matching how the kernel itself would continue resolving the rest of the
// original path after dereferencing one component. The returned fd is an
// open, O_DIRECTORY|O_NOFOLLOW descriptor for the final resolved directory;
// the caller is expected to write its own leaf through this SAME fd (see
// WriteAtNoFollowWithChown), never by re-resolving the original or
// resolved path as a string again, so nothing between this call returning
// and the leaf write can redirect the destination a second time. The
// caller owns the returned fd and must close it. A path of "/" itself
// resolves to an fd for the root directory.
