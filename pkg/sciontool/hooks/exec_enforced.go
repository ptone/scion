// EnforcedHooksDir is the dedicated, root-owned directory substrate-serve's
// bootstrap handler redirects broker-delivered $HOME/.scion/hooks/ content
// into, in privilege-drop-enforced mode. Kept as a single named identifier —
// not derived from anything else — so switching it later (e.g. if the
// live rootfs stat of "/run" ever changes) is a one-line change shared by
// both the writer (pkg/sciontool/substrate's writeBootstrapFile) and the
// reader (this package's LifecycleManager registration in
// cmd/sciontool/commands/init.go).
//
// Deliberately separate from /etc/scion/hooks (LifecycleManager's own
// system-default fallback): that directory's contents come from the image,
// not from a per-agent bootstrap write, and mixing the two would make a
// bootstrap-delivered file indistinguishable from one baked into the image.
//
// A package var, not a const, purely so a test can point it at a throwaway
// directory (e.g. to exercise skipRefusedEntry's EnforcedHooksDir exception
// without writing to the real, root-owned "/run/scion/hooks"). Production
// code never reassigns it.

// configureSharedWorkspaceGit). Never $TMPDIR or the system temp directory:
// on a runtime where root is a security boundary, that directory can be
// world-writable with no sticky bit, which lets the workload rename any
// entry out of it and plant a symlink in its place while root is still
// using it. Kept alongside EnforcedHooksDir under /run/scion for the same
// reason and with the same lifecycle: substrate-serve creates and clears it
// at every bootstrap (see pkg/sciontool/substrate's ensurePrivateTmpDir),
// exactly like it does for EnforcedHooksDir, so stale content from an
// earlier bootstrap of a reused actor can never survive into this one.

// uses errors.Is against this sentinel to decide whether a refused entry
// under a workload-owned hooks directory should be logged and skipped
