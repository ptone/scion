// undecided between two options:
//
//   - the actor's identity, minted by the broker via ateapi's MintActorJWT
//     (if a verifiable identity is available through the systemInfo volume);
//   - a fallback where the server accepts only the first bootstrap request
//     and correctness instead relies on a NetworkPolicy restricting router
//     ingress to the broker namespace.
//
// This interface lets either plug in without changing the HTTP handler.
// Until the decision lands, Server defaults to FirstBootstrapWinsVerifier
