// execAsUserCmd is a deliberate, near-verbatim copy of
// pkg/runtime.ExecAsUserCmd's wrapper script (see that file's doc comment
// for the full PAM/su rationale — the reasoning is identical here), with
// one intentional divergence: it conditionally passes `su -w <list>`.
//
// It is duplicated rather than imported: pkg/runtime transitively imports
// pkg/config, and sciontool must never import pkg/config (project path
// resolution has no business inside an agent container — see
// TestInitProjectDataIsolation in cmd/sciontool/commands/init_test.go,
// which fails the build if that boundary is crossed). pkg/runtime and
// pkg/sciontool/substrate are both owned by parallel work streams for this
// codebase, so extracting a shared leaf package for the whole function is
// left as a follow-up rather than done here — only the CA-bundle var names
// (substrateenv.TrustBundleVarNames) are actually shared, via a small
// dependency-free package both sides can import (see that package's doc
// comment).
//
// "sh", "su", and "whoami" are all resolved via execResolve (production:
// rootexec.Resolve) rather than left as bare names for the eventual shell to
// look up on its own PATH: this whole wrapper runs as root before any
// privilege drop, and a bare name here would otherwise be resolved against
// root's own inherited PATH, which on substrate includes a directory the
// workload owns outright (see the rootexec package doc comment). Resolving
// all three up front, and embedding the resulting absolute paths directly
// in the generated script, means the script's own behavior no longer
// depends on whatever PATH the resulting *exec.Cmd happens to run with —
// runExec still gives it rootexec.Env's fixed, from-scratch PATH as well,
// but only as defense in depth.
//
// The divergence: whenever the target user differs from the caller,
// execAsUserCmd runs `su - <user> -c <cmd>`, a login shell — and `su -`
// discards the entire inherited environment, including the CA-bundle env
// vars buildActorTemplate (pkg/runtime/substrate_template.go) sets on the
// container when egress_trust_bundle is configured. Left unfixed, any
// exec-invoked command (the broker exec endpoint, `scion look`, or
// `/scion/v1/exec` directly) that makes a TLS request loses the gateway CA
// even though the harness itself trusts it fine.
//
// The fix is util-linux `su`'s `-w`/`--whitelist-environment` flag: a
// comma-separated list of variable names to copy from the pre-su
// environment into the post-su one, on top of `su -`'s own minimal login
// set. `-w <list>` is passed ONLY when at least one of the candidate names
// is actually set (to a non-empty value) in the pre-su environment — never
// unconditionally — so a plain (non-sdsmint) install, where none of them
// is ever set, gets the exact `su - "$1" -c "$2"` this wrapper has always
// run: byte-identical script, byte-identical argv. `<list>` names only the
// candidates that ARE set, in substrateenv.TrustBundleVarNames's fixed
// order — the same slice pkg/runtime's buildActorTemplate builds the
// container's Env from — so the two lists cannot drift apart (see
// TestExecAsUserCmd_CandidateNamesMatchTemplateEnvNames).
//
// pkg/runtime.ExecAsUserCmd (used by every other runtime) is deliberately
// left untouched: only Substrate actors run under sdsmint, `-w` is a
// util-linux-specific flag (>= 2.35; scion's images are Debian trixie,
// which satisfies this) not guaranteed present on every other runtime's
// image, and this whole mechanism only exists to counter Substrate's own
// env-propagation shape.
