//     registry base (the repo root).
//  2. ProvisionAgent's worktree-mode create path (pkg/agent/provision.go,
//     config.SelectAgentsRoot/GetAgentDir): projectDir/agents/<name>/workspace
//     — a different shape WorktreeIsLexicallyUnderBase cannot express (it is
//     hardcoded to a single segment under a literal "worktrees", not two
//     segments under "agents" ending in "workspace"), so it gets its own
//     lexical check with the same fail-closed posture, without modifying the
//     frozen validator in worktree_validate.go.
//
// projectDir is the actual, resolved project directory the caller has in
// scope (config.GetResolvedProjectDir's return value) — NOT derived from base
// (e.g. as base/.scion). A project's .scion directory does not always sit at
// the repo top level (a project can be initialized in a repo subdirectory),
// so reconstructing it from base would false-reject a legitimate shape-2
// marker whenever that layout is in play, degrading it to a leak. Callers
// that have no meaningful shape-2 concept for their layout (ProvisionShared,
// the hub read path — both always produce shape-1 paths) pass projectDir="";
// isProvisionAgentWorkspaceShape then always reports false, leaving
// shape-1 as the sole check, which is correct for those callers.
//
// A candidate that matches NEITHER shape was not created by scion — most
// notably, ProvisionAgent's "attach to an existing worktree" path
// (util.FindWorktreeByBranch) can register a worktree anywhere git's own
// worktree list reports one, including a location a user created by hand.
// Such a path must never be used to mount or remove (see readMarker); it is

// pkg/provision, and pkg/config carries broker-side project-path resolution

// This is a purely lexical, string-only comparison — no filepath.EvalSymlinks

// built), not a check on where a path resolves on disk (that
// resolved-containment check belongs at the removal step in
// util.RemoveWorktree, a different concern). Resolving symlinks here would
// falsely reject a legitimate marker whenever any ancestor (a symlinked
// project directory, most commonly) differs textually between how the path
// was recorded and how it would resolve — see RegisterSharer's doc comment
// for the write-side half of this same concern (an immutable first-recorded
// path).

// recorded WorktreePath is backed by a real, on-disk worktree
// (hasRealWorktreeGitfile), later RegisterSharer calls never replace it; they
// only add/refresh the Sharers entry. A recorded path that is NOT currently
// backed by a real worktree (empty, or an externally-written or stale value
// with no .git there) is not worth protecting and is replaced normally — this is
// what lets a legitimate CREATE overwrite a stale or fake registry entry, per
// the existing JOIN-fallback-to-CREATE behavior in ensureWorktree.
//
// The immutability matters beyond just guarding against a peer overwriting a
// good path with a bad one: two legitimate callers can report the SAME
// on-disk worktree in two different string forms. pkg/agent's ProvisionAgent
// worktree-create path (:902) passes the RECORDED form it just built
// (matching config.SelectAgentsRoot's own construction, which
// WorktreePathIsScionCreated's classification check compares against
// lexically); its attach-to-existing-worktree path (:847) passes whatever
// util.FindWorktreeByBranch reports, which is git's own (possibly symlink-
// resolved) view of the same directory. If a later joiner's call were allowed
// to overwrite the creator's recorded form with git's resolved form — e.g.
// because some ancestor (a symlinked project directory, most commonly)
// differs between the two string forms — the marker would still point at the
// right directory on disk, but would no longer match the recorded-form shape
// the classification check expects, degrading a legitimate marker's
// WorktreePath to blank and leaking the worktree at the last sharer instead
// of removing it. Keeping a real recorded form immutable for the marker's
// life closes this from the write side; WorktreePathIsScionCreated's
// lexical-only (no EvalSymlinks) comparison closes the matching read-side
// gap — see its doc comment. Both are required together.
