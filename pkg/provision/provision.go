// Because the holder refreshes its heartbeat marker every
// provisionLockHeartbeatInterval for as long as it is actually alive — not
// just once at acquisition — this threshold bounds detection latency for a
// genuinely dead holder, not how long provisioning itself is allowed to
// take: a clone or chown that runs for an hour is fine, since each
// heartbeat resets the clock.
//
// This comparison is always done against another NFS-server-assigned
// timestamp (see serverNow), never this process's own clock — see
// lockLooksAbandoned's doc for why mixing clocks across nodes is unsafe and
// how this avoids it. The residual assumption is that the export server's
// mtime attribute reaches every node within its NFS attribute-cache window
// (acregmax/acdirmax, both default up to ~60s — the heartbeat and probe are
// regular files, governed by acregmax, but lastHeartbeat's fallback reads
// the lock DIRECTORY's own mtime, governed by acdirmax, and a reclaimer's
// visibility of a newly created heartbeat file at all depends on the
// directory's lookup cache too) — not that any two nodes' wall clocks
// agree with each other or with the server.

	// to still be retrying, not already failed, by the time a genuinely
	// abandoned lock becomes reclaimable — otherwise every concurrent start
	// for that project fails outright for the entire stale window, which is
	// worse than having no lock at all. The init container runs with
	// RestartPolicy: Never (pkg/runtime/k8s_runtime.go), so a waiter that
	// gives up fails the pod, not just this one attempt.

	// deadline), to avoid
	// callers with no ctx deadline of their own waiting forever on a
	// genuinely wedged (not crashed, not progressing) holder.

// container's fallback, it is the only lock any of them ever actually gets.
// Every concurrent provisioner for the same project already sees the same
// NFS-mounted dir identically — that shared filesystem, not a DB
// connection, is the coordination medium actually available in that context.
//
// dir is created (MkdirAll) if it does not yet exist: this lock must be
// acquired before ProvisionShared's own mkdir of the workspace directory
// runs, so on a project's first-ever start, dir may not exist yet.
//
// # Correctness argument
//
// lockPath (dir/provisionFileLockName) is always in exactly one of two
// states: EMPTY (no lock) or OCCUPIED-BY-T (a fully-formed lock directory
// carrying owner id T sits there — see tryCreateFileLock's doc for why it
// is never observed half-built). The only transitions are:
//
//  1. EMPTY → OCCUPIED-BY-T: tryCreateFileLock's publish, a single rename of
//     a fully-built staging directory onto lockPath. Of any number of
//     concurrent publish attempts, exactly one rename can win an empty
//     destination — that is what makes T unique per occupancy.
//  2. OCCUPIED-BY-T → EMPTY: exactly one rename, by EITHER a reclaimer
//     (tryReclaimIfAbandoned) or T's own holder releasing
//     (releaseFileLock), of the form rename(lockPath, lockPath+".evict-"+T).
//     The destination name is DETERMINISTIC in T, not a fresh name per
//     attempt: every caller that ever wants to remove generation T from
//     lockPath — whoever they are, however many of them there are, however
//     stale or fresh their own view of T is — targets that exact same
//     destination.
//
// # The invariant this depends on
//
// rename(2) does not inspect what it moves: `rename(lockPath, X)` relocates
// WHATEVER currently sits at lockPath, not specifically generation T. The
// only thing that stops a late remover of T — one still acting on a
// stale/cached read of T, interleaved with transition 1's publish of a live
// successor — from relocating that live successor is that its destination,
// ".evict-T", is already occupied by T's own, earlier removal. So: **from
// the instant T leaves lockPath until no observer of T can still attempt to
// remove it, ".evict-T" must exist.** Only while that holds can at most one
// rename ever succeed for a given T, and only then is it true that a
// rename's success proves lockPath still held that exact id at that
// instant. garbageCollectLockLitter is the one piece of code responsible
// for not breaking this invariant — see its doc for how it ages an
// ".evict-T" entry to stay within it, and tryReclaimIfAbandoned's doc for
// what happens in the remaining, narrow window where a late rename does
// land on a live successor (it is detected after the fact, not prevented).
//
// A stale/cached observer of a since-replaced T2 cannot evict T2 instead,
// because its rename targets ".evict-T" (the OLD generation it observed),
// not ".evict-T2" — those are different destination names by construction,
// so a remover of T can never collide with T2's own eventual removal. What
// the invariant above adds is the other half: T's OWN destination name must
// still be reserved for long enough that a late remover of T collides with
// it too, instead of finding it vacant and relocating whatever generation
// has since taken T's place.
//
// This holds regardless of how many nodes are involved or how stale any
// individual node's cached view of a prior generation is, PROVIDED every
// participant that can touch lockPath — not just a holder between
// heartbeats, but also a reclaimer between its staleness read and its
// rename, and a publisher between starting to build its staging directory
// and publishing it — stays within its own stated bound. See
// "Per-participant bounds" below.
//
// # Per-participant bounds
//
// All three bounds below are derived from the same underlying fact: an
// NFS-server-assigned timestamp can lag the event it records by up to the
// attribute-cache window (acregmax/acdirmax, ~60s by default) by the time
// another node observes it. Call the stale window S (provisionLockStaleAfter),
// the heartbeat interval I (provisionLockHeartbeatInterval), and the
// attribute-cache window A.
//
//   - Holder: pause + I + A < S. A reclaimer's view of the last heartbeat
//     can already lag by A, and the last beat it sees can itself be up to
//     one interval old, before the holder's own pause between beats is even
//     counted. At production defaults (S=3min, I=30s, A≈60s) this bounds a
//     tolerable holder pause to roughly 90s, not the full 3 minutes. A
//     genuinely live holder that keeps heartbeating faster than this is
//     never evicted — lockLooksAbandoned keeps judging it fresh, and a
//     reclaimer's own claim targets exactly the T it just read as stale, so
//     a legitimately alive holder is only evicted once it has gone silent
//     for longer than this bound. This bound is inherent to a lease with no
//     fencing mechanism and is not enforced in code, only documented and
//     accepted (see the PARTITIONED paragraph below).
//   - Reclaimer: the elapsed time in tryReclaimIfAbandoned from reading an
//     owner id to renaming it away is bounded at one S by a monotonic
//     elapsed-time guard, checked immediately before its rename —
//     comfortably under the garbage-collection cutoff of 2S (see "Why the
//     garbage-collection cutoff is 2S" below), leaving room for the rename
//     RPC itself to complete.
//   - Publisher: the elapsed time in tryCreateFileLock from starting to
//     build its staging directory to publishing it, plus the margin needed
//     for a cached reclaimer to still see this generation as fresh once
//     published. acquireFileLock beats once synchronously immediately after
//     a successful publish; WHEN THAT BEAT SUCCEEDS, it lands the first
//     heartbeat marker before this function ever returns, so the remaining
//     requirement is pre-publish-pause + A < S. If that beat instead fails
//     transiently, the periodic beat lands within one interval I, so the
//     requirement becomes pre-publish-pause + I + A < S — still satisfied by
//     the bound below at production defaults, so the bound does not depend
//     on the synchronous beat's success. (A DEFINITE loss from that beat is
//     a different case entirely — see its call site — and is never treated
//     as a successful acquisition.) tryCreateFileLock enforces a bound of
//     S/4 (at defaults, 45+60=105 < 180 with the synchronous beat, or
//     45+30+60=135 < 180 without it, both leaving real margin for the
//     publish rename RPC itself) via the same kind of monotonic
//     elapsed-time guard, checked immediately before its publish rename.
//   - Release: the elapsed time in releaseFileLock between its ownership
//     check and its eviction rename has the identical shape as the
//     reclaimer's window and is bounded the same way, at one S.
//
// # Why the garbage-collection cutoff is 2S
//
// A late remover of generation T — a reclaimer still acting on a cached
// read of T, or T's own holder releasing through a cached lookup — can act
// until roughly: the instant of T's eviction, plus the attribute-cache
// window A (how stale its own cached view of T can be before it even starts
// acting), plus its own elapsed-time guard's bound of one S, plus whatever
// the rename RPC itself adds on top (the one residual neither guard can
// see). The cutoff of 2S is therefore sufficient exactly when that residual
// stays under S − A (120s at production defaults). That residual covers
// ordinary RPC latency only: a partition or hang that begins AFTER the
// elapsed-time guard's own check but DURING the rename RPC itself is bounded
// by neither this margin nor any guard here — on a hard mount (the default)
// the client retransmits the same rename once the partition heals, and by
// then ".evict-T" may already be gone if more than 2S − A has elapsed since
// T's eviction. This is the same accepted partition/hang class described
// below, not a new gap this cutoff closes; a GC pause or an ordinary node
// stall BEFORE the rename is already caught by the elapsed-time guards
// above, well before a comparison against this cutoff would even be
// reached. garbageCollectLockLitter is the only place this cutoff is
// enforced; see its own doc for how it ages an entry against it.
//
// A crashed or killed participant is the intended failure mode here. One
// that is merely PARTITIONED or hung — still running, but unable to reach
// the NFS server for longer than its own bound above — is not: once the
// pause exceeds the bound, another participant may legitimately act on the
// resulting state, and the original one, on healing, continues running
// (its next heartbeat beat, its own elapsed-time guard on its next
// operation, or a stillOwned() check, is what would tell a holder
// specifically that it no longer holds the lock) until one of those
// actually happens. stillOwned()
// is checked before the sentinel write and before the clone-move step in
// gitCloneViaTempDir; a direct gitCloneDirect clone and ensureWorktree's
// git calls run under the lock-derived ctx (cancelled once the heartbeat
// notices) but do not re-verify ownership synchronously mid-operation. A
// holder partition longer than its bound, healing after one of those steps
// has already run, can therefore yield two concurrent writers into one
// workspace; this is accepted for the same reason the fixed wait budget
// below is (see its doc), not something this change closes. The
// reclaimer, publisher, and release guards above turn a pause that happens
// BEFORE their own rename into an aborted or retried attempt for those
// three participants — but a partition or hang that begins DURING the
// rename RPC itself, after the guard's own check has already passed, is
// bounded by none of them (see "Why the garbage-collection cutoff is 2S"
// above for why): it falls into this same accepted partition/hang class,
// detected after the fact by the reclaimer's own defensive post-rename
// owner check once it resumes, and not detected at all for release, which
// has no equivalent check.
//
// None of these bounds requires any two nodes' wall clocks to agree with
// each other or with the server: the holder/reclaimer comparison is
// between two server-assigned timestamps, and the reclaimer/publisher/
// release elapsed-time guards each measure only their own process's local
// monotonic clock across a single short operation, needing no shared
// reference at all. The one caveat is that a monotonic clock reading does
// not advance across a host suspend/resume (e.g. suspend-to-RAM, or a
// suspended VM) on Linux, so a node suspended between a guard's start and
// end wakes up with a small elapsed reading and acts on what is by then
// stale state — a suspend is treated the same as any other
// longer-than-bound pause: not measured, not prevented, and no worse than
// the accepted holder-partition case above.
//
// The overall wait is a wall-clock deadline (fileLockRetries *
// fileLockRetryDelay), not an attempt counter: tryReclaimIfAbandoned itself
// only performs a destructive rename after its own non-destructive
// staleness read says stale, so a fresh/live lock is never touched by it at
// all, and every outcome that isn't an actual eviction falls through to the
// same sleep-or-ctx select as plain contention — an attempt counter could
// otherwise be exhausted in milliseconds by a run of such outcomes with
// nothing to slow it down.
//
// One caveat neither this nor the staleness comparison below can fully
// close: NFSv3 write-class operations (MKDIR, RENAME, CREATE) are not
// required to be idempotent under retransmission. If a client's publish
// rename (in tryCreateFileLock) succeeds on the server but the reply is
// lost, the client's RPC layer may retransmit the same rename, and the
// retransmit can come back as a failure — to the very client that just
// published the lock. That client would then treat its own successful
// acquisition as a failure and back off; the lock it actually holds
// self-heals via the normal stale-reclaim path once no further heartbeats
// arrive (it thinks nobody owns it, so it never releases it either — an
// orphaned lock, not a corrupted one). This is a known NFS protocol
// wrinkle, not something a client-side retry loop can fully distinguish
// from genuine contention; documented here rather than solved.

// so it never legitimately has one; its presence means git's common-
// directory resolution for this gitdir would be redirected somewhere other
// than the mounted, host-managed .git. Rather than operate against an
// unknown/unverified location, the broker refuses.
var ErrCommondirPresent = errors.New("refusing git operation: base .git/commondir is present")

// HardenedGitCommand builds an *exec.Cmd for a broker-side git invocation
// against a project's shared hub-native worktree-per-agent base repo, with
// the invocation-level protections for the broker-git worktree containment
// change applied. It ensures the broker's own git operations honor only the
// host-managed config/hooks/refs for the base — never a redirected or
// otherwise unexpected location — and returns an error instead of running if
// it cannot establish that.
//
// Two mechanisms enforce this:
//   - GIT_COMMON_DIR is pinned to <dir>/.git on every invocation. Git
//     resolves config/hooks/refs through whatever "common directory" applies
//     to the gitdir it operates on; without pinning it, a top-level
//     <dir>/.git/commondir file (which git honors for the base's own gitdir,
//     not only for linked worktrees) can redirect that resolution elsewhere.
//     Pinning makes the common directory explicit and authoritative for
//     every call through this wrapper, independent of what any commondir
//     file says.
//   - As an additional check (and for detection), the wrapper first checks whether
//     <dir>/.git/commondir exists at all and refuses (ErrCommondirPresent)
//     if so, since a hub-native base never legitimately has one.
//
// It deliberately does NOT disable hooks (core.hooksPath), filters, aliases,
// or the global/system gitconfig — once the above holds, any hook/filter
// still configured for the base is host-managed and must keep running (most
// notably git-lfs: a post-checkout hook + filter.lfs.* smudge/clean driver).
// Specifically:
//   - GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1 / GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null were considered and
//     REJECTED: `git lfs install` writes filter.lfs.* to the global or system
//     gitconfig (not repo-local), so this would silently break LFS. It would
//     also strip broker-host config the broker legitimately relies on
//     (safe.directory, credential.helper, url.insteadOf, http.*,
//     core.sshCommand for its own auth) for no corresponding benefit.
//   - core.sshCommand is left alone for the same reason: this wrapper also
//     covers the base clone/pull paths, which may legitimately depend on the
//     broker's configured SSH transport.
//   - Alias neutralization is unnecessary: every caller here invokes an
//     explicit, hardcoded subcommand, never a user-suppliable one.
//
// What it does additionally clear:
//   - core.fsmonitor (both boolean and hook-path forms): not used by git-lfs
//     or any other broker operation, so clearing it costs nothing.
//   - core.pager=cat: purely cosmetic — a pager must never block
//     non-interactive broker output.
//
// dir is the working directory (cmd.Dir) and the base whose common directory
// is pinned; it must be non-empty. args are the git subcommand and its
// arguments, e.g. "worktree", "add", "--relative-paths", ... The returned
// cmd.Env starts as a copy of the broker process's environment plus
// GIT_COMMON_DIR; callers that need to layer additional env (e.g. the

//
// fsutil.CheckRoot runs first and refuses outright if projectRoot is a known
// critical system path or looks like a filesystem root by content — an
// additional guard against a resolution bug elsewhere computing an
// unintended chown root, independent of chownTarget's own narrower "/"
// handling, and standing in front of the shared-dir chown calls too, which
// do not route through chownTarget.
//
// Walks the tree itself (filepath.WalkDir + os.Lchown) rather than shelling
// out to the chown binary, for two reasons:
//
//   - No following of symlinks (F-111 review, tf-lead): a symlink inside a
//     cloned (possibly untrusted) repo pointing outside the chowned tree
//     (elsewhere in the init container's own filesystem view, or another
//     mounted shared dir) must have its REFERENT left alone — only the link
//     itself is re-owned. os.Lchown is exactly that operation, with no
//     dependency on a particular chown binary's own flag support.
//   - lockDir, when non-empty, is the SAME directory the file-lock fallback
//     above publishes its lock into (see resolveSentinelDir and the k8s
//     init container's SentinelDir, which has no other directory available
//     to it in that mount) — so when projectRoot IS that directory, a plain
//     recursive chown walking the whole tree would also walk the lock's own
//     live directory, its staging and evicted-generation entries, and its
//     clock-probe files — every one of them transient bookkeeping a
//     CONCURRENT waiter is free to create, rename, or remove at any moment
//     while this holder is still walking underneath them (see
//     acquireFileLock's correctness argument). A waiter's own probe file
//     disappearing mid-walk, or an evicted entry being swept by garbage
//     collection mid-walk, is completely unrelated to the actual
//     provisioning work and must never be able to fail it. isLockArtifactPath
//     identifies that entire prefix by name alone (never stat'd), so none
//     of it is ever visited, stat'd, or chowned — excluded rather than
//     interleaved with.
//
// The exclusion applies ONLY to DIRECT children of lockDir itself, never at
// any other depth and never when lockDir is empty: the lock only ever lives
// directly inside lockDir (see acquireFileLock's doc — it is never nested),
// so a project file or directory anywhere else that merely happens to share
// the lock's name prefix (in a cloned repo, or inside a shared dir, which
// never holds the lock at all) is ordinary content and must still be
// chowned like everything else, not silently skipped and left under the
// init container's root ownership.
//
// Never calls os.Chown or os.Chmod on a walked path — only lchownFile
// (os.Lchown in production), which operates on the path by name and never
// dereferences a symlink regardless of what currently sits at that name, so
// a symlink swapped in between WalkDir observing it and this call still has
// only its own link ownership changed, never a followed target's. WalkDir
// itself never descends into a symlinked directory (a symlink's DirEntry
// carries the link's own mode bits from its parent's directory read, not
// the target's, so d.IsDir() is false for it) — nothing here calls
// os.ReadDir or otherwise manually recurses, so that default holds
// unmodified. The walk starts at, and never climbs above, projectRoot:
// WalkDir only ever descends into children it discovers itself.
//
// Continues past a per-entry failure — a failed Lchown, or a path that
// disappeared between being listed and being visited — rather than
// aborting the whole walk on the first one, the same as the recursive
// chown binary this replaces: every reachable path still gets a real
// attempt, and the first failure (if any) is what gets returned, not
// necessarily the only one. A ctx cancellation is the one thing that stops
// the walk outright, matching the previous exec.CommandContext-based
// implementation being killed on cancellation.
//
// TestChownProjectTree_DanglingSymlink_DoesNotFail is the regression guard
// on no-dereference: a symlink to a path that exists nowhere, so re-owning
// the link itself (Lchown) succeeds while resolving it (Chown) would fail
// with ENOENT. It needs no timing assumptions and fails deterministically if
// the walk ever starts dereferencing.
