// stateDirMode is the mode PrepareStateDir gives a provisioning state
// directory: setgid, so new entries keep its group, group read, write and
// search, so the broker and the provisioning init container can both take
// and reclaim the lock in it, and read and search for others, the same 2775
// as a broker-created leaf. Others keep search access so a broker outside
// the group can still see whether the sentinel exists, as it could when the
// sentinel was in the workspace root (the sentinel and lock carry no
// secrets).
const stateDirMode = 0o2775

// PrepareStateDir checks the provisioning state directory mounted into the
// Kubernetes init container at dir (the root of its own subPath mount) and,
// when fixOwnership is set, gives it to uid:gid with mode 2775.
//
// sciontool passes fixOwnership whenever the workspace chown is strict, that
// is unless the runtime set ChownBestEffortEnv. The runtime sets that only
// when the broker created, or found with setgid and group write, EVERY
// directory the pod mounts from the claim (the aggregate prepared flag), not
// just this one. So a state directory the broker did create is still chowned
// and chmodded when any other leaf was left to the node, and the kubelet-made
// case (no export mount on the broker, or no permission) is always covered.
// Only dir itself is changed, never anything in it.
//
// It fails closed: dir must be an absolute, clean path to a real directory.
// A symlink, a regular file or any other non-directory is an error,
// whatever fixOwnership says. The directory is opened with O_NOFOLLOW and
// changed through that descriptor, so a path swapped for a symlink between
// the check and the change is never followed. A failed chown is an error
// unless the directory already has the wanted owner (as on an export that
// maps root to the workspace owner, see checkChownEPERM).
