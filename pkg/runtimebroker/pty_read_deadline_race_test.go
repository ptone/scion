// TestPokeReadDeadlineUntilDone_WinsRaceAgainstLatePongHandler regression-
// tests the teardown race a single SetReadDeadline(now) call has against the
// keepalive's pong handler: the handler runs on the same reader goroutine,
// inside ReadMessage, so a pong whose payload was already read but whose
// handler had not yet fired when the deadline was forced into the past can
// still push it back out by PongWait right afterward — stalling the reader
// (and everything joined on it) for up to PongWait instead of returning
// promptly.
//
// The interleaving is forced deterministically rather than left to a
// wall-clock race: the pong handler blocks, after consuming the pong's
// payload, until the test releases it — exactly the "payload read, handler
// not yet run" window the real race depends on. pokeReadDeadlineUntilDone
// must reclaim the deadline on its next tick regardless of when the handler
// wins that race.
