# scripts/single-node-vm/hybrid-tier.sh — hybrid-tier (attach-only GKE
# target) additions for deploy.sh: config parsing, cluster discovery, and
# the two NFS firewall rules the hub VM needs to serve shared dirs to GKE
# agent pods.
#
# This file is meant to be `source`d by deploy.sh, never executed directly.
# It depends on the caller already having defined `config_get`,
# `config_prompt`, `info`, `warn`, `err` and `PYTHON` (deploy.sh defines all
# of these before sourcing this file), and on `set -euo pipefail` already
# being in effect.
#
# Every function here is a plain shell function operating on explicit
# arguments and a small set of documented globals (HYBRID_ENABLED,
# GKE_PROJECT, GKE_LOCATION, GKE_NAME, GKE_NODE_TAG, GKE_NODE_SUBNET_CIDR,
# GKE_POD_CIDR, HYBRID_ALLOW_NAME, HYBRID_DENY_NAME, HYBRID_HUB_ALLOW_NAME,
# HYBRID_INTERNAL_IP, HYBRID_TEARDOWN_*), so the test
# harness under tests/ can source this file on its own -- with its own stub
# `config_get`/`info`/`warn`/`err` and a stub `gcloud` on PATH -- without
# ever loading or running deploy.sh itself.
#
# Scope: the config block, discovery, and the two firewall rules, end to
# end (create and teardown). The cluster itself is always an existing,
# attach-only target -- this file never creates or deletes one.
#
# Array expansions throughout this file use the
# `${arr[@]+"${arr[@]}"}` idiom instead of a bare `"${arr[@]}"` wherever
# the array in question can legitimately be empty. Under `set -u`, an
# empty array's bare `"${arr[@]}"` is an unbound-variable error on bash
# older than 4.4 (macOS ships 3.2), even though it is a documented no-op
# on 4.4+; the `+` form is the portable way to say "zero or more
# elements" on every bash version this script might run under.

# treated as "gone": anything mentioning permission or forbidden is

# read-only (describe); nothing is created. Sets GKE_NODE_TAG,
# GKE_NODE_SUBNET_CIDR, and GKE_POD_CIDR. Exits non-zero with an
# actionable message, naming the cluster and (where relevant) what was
# found, if the cluster can't be described, is on a different network
# than the hub VM, its node subnet or pod CIDR can't be determined or
# has an invalid or dangerously broad IP range, or no single node tag
# can be discovered -- always before any resource is created. Every
# failure message includes gcloud's own stderr rather than assuming "not
# found": a permission or API-disabled error looks nothing like a missing
# cluster, and reporting it as one would send an operator chasing the
# wrong fix.
#
# The node subnet -- not the pod CIDR or any secondary range -- is what
# the NFS export's client list is built from: nodes, not pods, originate
# the NFS mount traffic that reaches the VM. The NFS firewall allow
# rule's source is unrelated to this and continues to use the node
# network tag discovered above, not an IP range. The pod CIDR is used
# only by the separate hub-allow firewall rule (tcp:8080), whose traffic
# genuinely does originate from pod IPs.
#
# Node-tag discovery reads the node tag GKE assigns, from the cluster's
# own GKE-managed firewall rules, the same source for Standard and
# Autopilot clusters alike: it lists the firewall rules on the cluster's
# network, and looks among them for the one rule matching ^gke-.+-all$,
# direction INGRESS, whose source ranges include this cluster's own pod
# CIDR -- pod CIDRs are unique within a VPC, so this ties the rule to
# this specific cluster. That rule must carry exactly one target tag,
# matching ^gke-.+-node$, and the matching <same-prefix>-vms rule must
# exist and carry the same single target tag. Anything else -- no
# matching rule, more than one, the wrong shape of tags, or the -vms
# rule missing or disagreeing -- refuses to guess and fails instead,

# allow before deny. Call only after confirming HYBRID_TEARDOWN_FAILED=
# false, and only once the hub VM is confirmed gone (the caller's
# responsibility -- see docs/deploy/agent-runbook-single-node-vm.md).
# Stops at the first delete that isn't confirmed gone -- via `delete`
# succeeding, or, on a `delete` failure, a positive not-found from
# `_hybrid_firewall_rule_absent` -- and leaves every rule from that point
# on untouched, so the deny is never deleted after the allow delete
# failed or came back uncertain. Sets HYBRID_TEARDOWN_DELETED to the
# rules actually gone afterward and HYBRID_TEARDOWN_DELETE_FAILED to the
# first rule that wasn't (and, transitively, every rule still queued
# behind it). The caller must treat a non-empty
# HYBRID_TEARDOWN_DELETE_FAILED as a failed teardown, and must only
# report HYBRID_TEARDOWN_DELETED as deleted. Never deletes the cluster;
# this tier never creates or deletes a cluster in the first place.
