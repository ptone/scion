# scripts/single-node-vm/hybrid-tier.sh — hybrid-tier (attach-only GKE
# target) additions for deploy.sh: config parsing, cluster discovery, and
# the two NFS firewall rules the hub VM needs to serve shared dirs to GKE
# agent pods.
#
# This file is meant to be `source`d by deploy.sh, never executed directly.
# It depends on the caller already having defined `config_get`,
# `config_prompt`, `info`, `warn`, `err` and `PYTHON` (deploy.sh defines all
# of these before sourcing this file), and on `set -euo pipefail` already
# being in effect.
#
# Every function here is a plain shell function operating on explicit
# arguments and a small set of documented globals (HYBRID_ENABLED,
# GKE_PROJECT, GKE_LOCATION, GKE_NAME, GKE_NODE_TAG, GKE_NODE_SUBNET_CIDR,
# GKE_POD_CIDR, HYBRID_ALLOW_NAME, HYBRID_DENY_NAME, HYBRID_HUB_DENY_NAME,
# HYBRID_INTERNAL_IP, HYBRID_TRANSPORT_SA_EMAIL, HYBRID_IAP_CLIENT_ID,
# HYBRID_TEARDOWN_*), so the test
# harness under tests/ can source this file on its own -- with its own stub
# `config_get`/`info`/`warn`/`err` and a stub `gcloud` on PATH -- without
# ever loading or running deploy.sh itself.
#
# Scope: the config block, discovery, and the two firewall rules, end to
# end (create and teardown). The cluster itself is always an existing,
# attach-only target -- this file never creates or deletes one.
#
# Array expansions throughout this file use the
# `${arr[@]+"${arr[@]}"}` idiom instead of a bare `"${arr[@]}"` wherever
# the array in question can legitimately be empty. Under `set -u`, an
# empty array's bare `"${arr[@]}"` is an unbound-variable error on bash
# older than 4.4 (macOS ships 3.2), even though it is a documented no-op
# on 4.4+; the `+` form is the portable way to say "zero or more
# elements" on every bash version this script might run under.

# read-only (describe); nothing is created. Sets GKE_NODE_TAG,
# GKE_NODE_SUBNET_CIDR, and GKE_POD_CIDR. Exits non-zero with an
# actionable message, naming the cluster and (where relevant) what was
# found, if the cluster can't be described, is on a different network
# than the hub VM, its node subnet or pod CIDR can't be determined or
# has an invalid or dangerously broad IP range, or no single node tag
# can be discovered -- always before any resource is created. Every
# failure message includes gcloud's own stderr rather than assuming "not
# found": a permission or API-disabled error looks nothing like a missing
# cluster, and reporting it as one would send an operator chasing the
# wrong fix.
#
# The node subnet -- not the pod CIDR or any secondary range -- is what
# the NFS export's client list is built from: nodes, not pods, originate
# the NFS mount traffic that reaches the VM. The NFS firewall allow
# rule's source is unrelated to this and continues to use the node
# network tag discovered above, not an IP range. The pod CIDR is used
# only by the separate hub-deny firewall rule (all protocols), which
# blocks that same pod range from reaching the hub VM directly over the
# VPC.
#
# Node-tag discovery reads the node tag GKE assigns, from the cluster's
# own GKE-managed firewall rules, the same source for Standard and
# Autopilot clusters alike: it lists the firewall rules on the cluster's
# network, and looks among them for the one rule matching ^gke-.+-all$,
# direction INGRESS, whose source ranges include this cluster's own pod
# CIDR -- pod CIDRs are unique within a VPC, so this ties the rule to
# this specific cluster. That rule must carry exactly one target tag,
# matching ^gke-.+-node$, and the matching <same-prefix>-vms rule must
# exist and carry the same single target tag. Anything else -- no
# matching rule, more than one, the wrong shape of tags, or the -vms
# rule missing or disagreeing -- refuses to guess and fails instead,

#   IMAGE_PATH IMAGE_SIZE_GB
#
# IMAGE_PATH is a parameter (rather than reading the HYBRID_NFS_IMAGE_PATH
# constant directly) purely so tests can point it at a throwaway temp
# path when executing the rendered script for real -- the real caller
# (deploy.sh) always passes $HYBRID_NFS_IMAGE_PATH.
#
# Renders the remote script that idempotently:
#   1. creates the backing image file (IMAGE_PATH) at IMAGE_SIZE_GB
#      gigabytes with fallocate (which actually reserves the space,
#      unlike a sparse truncate, and fails clearly -- removing the
#      partial file -- if the disk can't hold it) and formats it ext4,
#      but ONLY the first time -- an existing image file is never
#      re-created or re-mkfs'd, since doing so would destroy whatever
#      the export already holds;
#   2. adds an /etc/fstab entry loop-mounting that image at EXPORT_ROOT,
#      with BOTH x-systemd.before=nfs-server.service (orders the mount
#      before the NFS server unit) AND x-systemd.required-by=
#      nfs-server.service (makes it an actual dependency, not just an
#      ordering) -- before= alone only orders the units; on a failed
#      mount it would let nfs-server start anyway and export whatever's
#      really at EXPORT_ROOT (the boot disk's root filesystem), exactly
#      the exposure this dedicated filesystem exists to close. Because
#      required-by= is set, systemd-fstab-generator does not also
#      attach this mount to local-fs.target (systemd.mount(5)), so a
#      failed mount blocks only nfs-server, never boot; nofail is kept
#      anyway, defensively, to keep that same "boot never blocks on
#      this mount" property true even if required-by= is ever removed
#      from this line. The fsck pass is 0: systemd-fstab-generator only
#      ever schedules fsck for device paths, so a nonzero pass on this
#      loop-mounted regular file is a no-op that just logs a boot-time
#      warning. A pre-existing fstab line for this image with different
#      options is never silently replaced -- the script fails with the
#      expected line, rather than guessing which options should win.
#      Then mounts it if it isn't already, and verifies (findmnt +
#      losetup) that whatever ends up mounted at EXPORT_ROOT is
#      actually the loop device backing IMAGE_PATH, not a stray tmpfs
#      or bind mount left over from something else;
#   3. fails closed -- before writing or activating anything below --
#      if EXPORT_ROOT is not actually a mountpoint after that: this is
#      the deploy-time half of the guarantee; the exports line's own
#      `mp` option (see hybrid_nfs_export_line) is the export-side half,
#      and additionally covers a mount that fails on a later reboot,
#      which this one-time check can't. A
#      /etc/systemd/system/scion-hub.service.d/10-scion-shared.conf
#      drop-in adds RequiresMountsFor=EXPORT_ROOT to scion-hub.service
#      (tier-on only; the base service install is unaffected when the
#      tier is off), so the hub itself -- which creates shared-dir
#      paths under EXPORT_ROOT for the co-located Docker broker -- can
#      never start against an unmounted export and write to the boot
#      disk's root filesystem instead, the same split this whole layout
#      exists to prevent on the NFS side;
#   4. sets ownership/mode on the now-mounted export root (scion:scion,
#      mode 2755 so the squash uid can't write it), installs
#      nfs-kernel-server if it isn't already, disables NFSv2/v3/4.0 and
#      UDP via /etc/nfs.conf.d (this tier is NFSv4.1/TCP-only, matching
#      the PV's own nfsvers=4.1) and masks rpcbind (unneeded once v2/v3
#      are off), verifying the mask actually took rather than assuming
#      it did, writes this hub's own file under /etc/exports.d/ (using
#      hybrid_nfs_export_line for the rendered line, so the two stay in
#      sync), re-exports, and enables the server under its canonical
#      unit name (nfs-server; nfs-kernel-server is only the Debian/
#      Ubuntu package name). A restart -- not just enable --now, which
#      would be a no-op against an already-running unit -- only happens
#      when it's actually needed: either this is the first time
#      /etc/nfs.conf.d/scion-hub.conf has this exact content (apt's
#      postinst already started the server with the stock v2/v3/UDP-
#      enabled config before this script's write, so the very first
#      run must restart to pick up v4.1/TCP-only), or nfs-server isn't
#      confirmed already active, or /proc/fs/nfsd/versions shows the
#      running kernel still has v3 or v4.0 enabled (a version the
#      config write alone can't retroactively disable for an already-
#      running server). Every later re-run with unchanged content, a
#      confirmed-active server, and v3/v4.0 both confirmed off leaves
#      it running untouched, avoiding an NFSv4 grace-period stall
#      (during which GKE clients can't reclaim or open new state) on
#      every redeploy. Fails closed toward restarting: an inconclusive
#      "is it active" or "which versions are on" check is treated the
#      same as "needs a restart".
# Always rewrites the exports file and re-exports, which is how the
# export picks up a changed CIDR on re-run with no separate drift
# detection needed. Pure string rendering -- no gcloud or SSH calls --
# so it's directly unit-testable; the caller is responsible for actually
# running the result over SSH, after the squash identity script above

# Compares an already-marked, pre-existing rule against every field able
# to widen, narrow or disable it: direction, action, disabled, priority,
# network, allowed/denied (all entries), sourceTags, sourceRanges,
# sourceServiceAccounts, targetServiceAccounts, targetTags,
# destinationRanges. Every other field is ignored, including
# non-scoping settable fields (description, logConfig) and output-only
# metadata (id, name, kind, selfLink, creationTimestamp). SOURCE_TYPE is
# "tag" or "range"; the *other* source field is expected empty, since a
# rule this tier creates only ever sets one of them, and GCP ORs the two
# when both are present. Service accounts and destination ranges are
# always expected empty, and disabled is always expected false.
#
# On a full match, returns 0 silently. On any mismatch, prints every
# differing field, then the delete remediation, then an `update`
# remediation too, but only when `update` can converge to *exactly* the
# expected rule -- every other field already matches, and the only drift
# left is something it can set directly (the expected source type,
# target tags, priority). If a field would need to be cleared, or
# `update` can't touch it (direction, action, network, rule entries,
# service accounts, disabled), only delete is offered. For the deny
# rule, the delete remediation is the two-rule, order-preserving sequence
# (delete allow, delete deny, re-run deploy.sh) rather than a bare
# delete, since deleting the deny alone would leave tcp:2049 reachable
# through the allow rule with nothing to deny it. Never corrects

# name and <hub prefix> is at most the first 12 characters of the hub
# name, with any trailing hyphen dropped. GCP service-account ids must be
# 6-30 characters of [a-z0-9-], starting with a letter and ending in a
# letter or digit; the longest possible result is 9 + 12 + 1 + 8 = 30.
#   - The prefix is readable only; the hash is what tells hubs apart, so
#     two hub names that share their first 12 characters still get
#     different ids (a hash collision between two specific hub names is
#     possible in principle but vanishingly unlikely, and would surface
#     as the ownership-marker refusal below, never as silent sharing).
#   - "scion-tp-" can never equal deploy.sh's own base SA id, which
#     always starts with "scion-hub-", whatever either hub is named.
#   - Deterministic for a given hub name, so a redeploy or teardown
