# scripts/single-node-vm/tests/test_deploy_base.sh — a base smoke test:
# runs upstream deploy.sh itself as a real subprocess against the stub
# `gcloud` on PATH, through a fresh create and then a re-run against the
# state the fresh create left behind, and asserts on the key gcloud calls
# each makes. This is the harness's own proof that it works against
# deploy.sh on `main`, with no feature-specific code (hybrid tier, NAT
# reuse, IAP firewall scope, ...) involved at all.
#
# This file has no shebang -- it is always `source`d, never executed --
# so shellcheck needs an explicit shell directive to know its dialect.
