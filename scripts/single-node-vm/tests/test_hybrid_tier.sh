# This file has no shebang -- it is always `source`d, never executed --

# twice, and can't distinguish a fail-closed guard that actually stops
# the script from one that's dead code after an early `set -e` exit
# elsewhere. Every command the script invokes that could otherwise touch
# a REAL absolute path on the machine running the tests (mkdir, install,
# mkfs.ext4, fallocate, mount, mountpoint, systemctl, dpkg, apt-get,
# exportfs, chown, chmod, tee, findmnt, losetup, and sudo itself) is
# faked and put first on PATH. `grep` and `awk` are real (the script's
# own FSTAB_PATH parameter, not a PATH trick, is what points its fstab
# reads at a per-test fixture file instead of the real /etc/fstab --
# see hybrid_nfs_export_script's own fstab_path parameter). `cat`
# delegates to the real binary except for a read of the literal path
# /etc/nfs.conf.d/scion-hub.conf, which is redirected to a per-test
# fixture file (dir/.nfs-conf-existing, absent by default) so a test can
# exercise the conditional-restart logic without touching the real
# machine's file.
# MOUNTED selects the `mountpoint`/`mount` fakes' behavior, tracked via
# a marker file (dir/.mounted) rather than a fixed answer, so the two
# checks the rendered script makes (before attempting to mount, and the
# fail-closed check after) can behave differently within one run:
#   true    -- the marker pre-exists: mountpoint succeeds from the very
#              first check, so `mount` must never be called at all.
#   false   -- no marker, and `mount` never creates one: mountpoint
#              fails both times, exercising the fail-closed exit.
#   becomes -- no marker at start, but `mount` creates one when run: the
#              first check fails, `mount` runs exactly once, and the
#              fail-closed check then succeeds.
# `findmnt`/`losetup` are wired to report IMAGE_PATH as the mount's
# backing file, so the new mount-source verification passes for every
# existing test that doesn't care about it -- MOUNT_BACK_OVERRIDE lets a
# test point that verification at a *different* path, to exercise its
# failure mode.
