# scripts/single-node-vm/tests/test_iap_fw_scope.sh — regression coverage
# for the IAP SSH firewall rule scoping fix (ptone/scion#1807): deploy.sh
# must tag the hub VM and create/update the IAP SSH firewall rule with
# --target-tags, so it no longer allows IAP-range SSH to every VM on
# network default, and must never narrow an existing unscoped rule until
# the hub VM's tag is actually confirmed this run.
#
# Runs upstream deploy.sh itself as a real subprocess against the stub
# `gcloud` on PATH, the same way test_deploy_base.sh does. Per-file
# isolation (see README.md "How it works") means this file cannot reuse
# test_deploy_base.sh's run_deploy_create/_start_deploy_bg/_stop_deploy_bg
# — they are defined here too, not shared, on purpose.
#
# This file has no shebang -- it is always `source`d, never executed --
# so shellcheck needs an explicit shell directive to know its dialect.
