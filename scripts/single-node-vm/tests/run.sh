# scripts/single-node-vm/tests/run.sh — runs every test_*.sh file in this
# directory against a stub `gcloud`.
#
# This never contacts GCP: it puts tests/lib (containing a stub `gcloud`
# and a stub `kubectl`) at the front of PATH, sources tests/lib/harness.sh
# once for shared fixture and assertion helpers and hybrid-tier.sh once
# for the function-level tests, then sources every tests/test_*.sh file
# (sorted) -- each in its own subshell -- and calls each test_* function
# it finds. Test files that drive deploy.sh itself run it as a real
# subprocess against the same stub; see README.md for how to add a new
# stub case, fixture, and test file.
#
# ISOLATION: each test file is sourced into its own subshell, not into
# run.sh's own shell. A file-level global or helper (e.g. HUB,
# run_deploy_create) is therefore private to the file that defines it --
# two files defining the same name never clobber each other, and there is
# no ordering dependency between files. See README.md "How it works" for
# the mechanics and for what this does and doesn't isolate.
#
# Requires python3: the stub's own JSON fixtures (see tests/lib/gcloud)
# are built and parsed with it. jq is optional -- deploy.sh shells out to
# it, when available, only to parse a GitHub Releases response for its
# default VERSION, and every test in this suite passes --version to skip
# that path.
#
# The settings.yaml parse tests in test_deploy_wiring.sh also require a Go
# toolchain: they run `go run -buildvcs=false
# tests/lib/settings-yaml-to-json.go` from the repository root, which
# needs the repository's github.com/knadh/koanf YAML parser module in the
# Go module cache (fetched on first use when the network allows it).
# Without Go, those tests fail rather than skip.
#
# Requires bash >= 4 (uses `mapfile` and associative arrays). This is a
# dev-only test runner, not a deployment artifact: deploy.sh and
# hybrid-tier.sh themselves target bash 3.2+ (macOS's shipped /bin/bash),
# but this runner does not need to, and is not the vehicle for verifying
# that support -- see the bash-3.2 note in hybrid-tier.sh's header.
#
# Usage:
#   ./run.sh

# Deliberately no -e: assertions and helpers here routinely run commands
# (e.g. `grep -c` on a log with zero matches) whose non-zero exit is
# expected and meaningful, not a script error. -e would abort the whole
# suite on the first one instead of reporting a normal pass/fail count.
