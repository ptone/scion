# scripts/single-node-vm/tests/test_deploy_wiring.sh — tests that run
# deploy.sh itself as a real subprocess against the stub `gcloud` on
# PATH, to cover the wiring between deploy.sh and hybrid-tier.sh that a
# function-level test (test_hybrid_tier.sh) cannot reach: whether
# deploy.sh actually calls hybrid_discover before its first create, gates
# --tags/add-tags on HYBRID_ENABLED, and puts the ownership check before
# any delete in --delete mode. No test here contacts GCP.
#
# This file has no shebang -- it is always `source`d, never executed --
# so shellcheck needs an explicit shell directive to know its dialect.
# shellcheck shell=bash
#
# Driving deploy.sh: each test writes a JSON config file and runs
# `bash deploy.sh --config FILE [--delete]` as a real subprocess, with
# PATH already pointing at the stub gcloud (run.sh exports it) and stdin
# redirected from /dev/null so deploy.sh's own `[[ ! -t 0 ]]` checks take
# the non-interactive branch. --delete-mode tests run to completion in
# well under a second, since nothing in that path sleeps or retries.
# create-mode tests are wrapped in `timeout`: past VM creation, deploy.sh
# moves on to an SSH-readiness retry loop with real sleeps between
# attempts, and this suite only needs the log up through VM creation, not
# a full (simulated) deploy. The stub's default "unhandled invocation"
# case makes `compute ssh` fail immediately, so the wall-clock cost is
# just the SSH_BACKOFF_FAST_SECS sleep between the first couple of
# attempts before the timeout fires.
