# scripts/single-node-vm/tests/test_hardened_org.sh — coverage for
# deploy.sh's hardened-GCP-org network handling (restage of upstream
# GoogleCloudPlatform/scion#1928, by nhodson, commit 2 of 2): the fail-fast
# default-network check, and the scoped tcp:8080 proxy-to-VM firewall rule
# that replaces an implicit dependency on default-allow-internal. See
# test_proxy_hardening.sh for the commit-1 defaults (shielded VM,
# dedicated proxy SA, one-step IAP deploy).
#
# Runs upstream deploy.sh itself as a real subprocess against the stub
# `gcloud` on PATH, the same way test_deploy_base.sh and
# test_iap_fw_scope.sh do. Per-file isolation (see README.md "How it
# works") means this file cannot reuse those files' helpers -- they are
# defined here too, not shared, on purpose.
#
# This file has no shebang -- it is always `source`d, never executed --
# so shellcheck needs an explicit shell directive to know its dialect.
# shellcheck shell=bash
