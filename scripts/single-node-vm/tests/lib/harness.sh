# scripts/single-node-vm/tests/lib/harness.sh — shared helpers for the
# deploy.sh gcloud-stub test harness. Sourced by run.sh, never executed
# directly.
#
# Provides: stub info/warn/err/config_get/config_prompt (stand-ins for
# any future function-level test that sources a deploy.sh helper
# directly, the way this file's own caller expects them to already be
# defined), a fresh-per-test gcloud stub state dir on PATH, and small
# assertion helpers. No test here ever contacts GCP; the only `gcloud` on
# PATH is tests/lib/gcloud.
#
# This file has no shebang -- it is always `source`d, never executed --
# so shellcheck needs an explicit shell directive to know its dialect.
