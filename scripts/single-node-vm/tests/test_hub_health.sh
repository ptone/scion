# scripts/single-node-vm/tests/test_hub_health.sh — function-level tests
# for deploy.sh's hub_health_status / wait_for_hub_health (ptone/scion#1094):
# /healthz always returns HTTP 200, so the post-install health checks read
# the body's top-level status. healthy passes; degraded at the last attempt
# passes with a warning naming the checks; unhealthy or no answer fails.
#
# The two functions are extracted from deploy.sh by name and eval'd, the
# same function-level style as the other tests that source a single helper
# (see README.md); deploy.sh itself is never run. `gcloud compute ssh` goes
# to the stub (tests/lib/gcloud), whose /healthz answer is set through
# GCLOUD_STUB_HEALTHZ_BODY.
#
# This file has no shebang -- it is always `source`d, never executed --
# so shellcheck needs an explicit shell directive to know its dialect.
# shellcheck shell=bash
