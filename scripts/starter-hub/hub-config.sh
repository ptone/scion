# scripts/starter-hub/hub-config.sh - Shared configuration for all starter-hub scripts
#
# Set HUB_NAME before sourcing this file to parameterize all scripts for a
# specific deployment. For example:
#
#   export HUB_NAME=staging
#   ./scripts/starter-hub/gce-demo-deploy.sh
#
# All resource names, domains, and file paths are derived from HUB_NAME and
# BASE_DOMAIN. Override any individual variable via the environment if the
# derived default doesn't fit your setup.

# --- Primary Configuration ---
# HUB_NAME drives all resource naming. Defaults to "demo".
HUB_NAME="${HUB_NAME:-demo}"
BASE_DOMAIN="${BASE_DOMAIN:-scion-ai.dev}"

# --- Feature Flags ---
# Set to "false" to skip GKE cluster creation, credential setup, and
# container.admin IAM role. The hub will run with Docker as the default runtime.
