# deploy.sh — deploy a single-node Scion Hub on a Cloud Run Instance with IAP.
#
# This script implements the complete deploy flow:
#   1. Resolves the deploying operator's identity
#   2. Resolves the GCP project number
#   3a. Creates or updates the Cloud Run Instance via gcloud (v1 surface,
#       required because sandboxLauncher is a v1-only field)
#   3b. Enables IAP via REST v2 PATCH (iapEnabled + invokerIamDisabled are
#       v2-only fields)
#   4. Waits for IAP enforcement to become active (30-75s)
#   5. Binds the IAP access policy for the operator
#   6. Prints effective access (project-level and region-level)
#   7. Asserts the IAP perimeter is enforcing (fails loudly if not)
#   8. Prints the Instance URL
#
# The script is idempotent: re-running converges without duplication.
# iapEnabled and invokerIamDisabled are sent on EVERY write to prevent
# silent perimeter drops.
#
# Usage:
#   ./deploy.sh --name NAME --project PROJECT --image IMAGE [options]
#
# Required:
#   --name        Instance name (e.g. my-scion-hub)
#   --project     GCP project ID
#   --image       Container image (tag or digest)
#
# Optional:
#   --region          GCP region (default: us-east4)
#   --admin-email     Admin email override (default: deployer's gcloud account)
#   --service-account GCP service account for the instance
#   --memory          Memory limit (default: 8Gi)
#   --cpu             CPU limit (default: 4)
#   --image-registry  Override image registry (default: derived from --image)

Error: 'gcloud beta run instances' is not available in your Cloud SDK.

This deploy requires 'gcloud beta run instances deploy --sandbox-launcher',
which is not present in all SDK versions. Measured: absent at 575.0.0,
present at 582.0.0.

Update your SDK:

  gcloud components update
  # or, on Debian/Ubuntu:
  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get --only-upgrade install google-cloud-cli

DO NOT use 'gcloud alpha run instances' instead. gcloud may suggest it, but
the alpha surface uses 'create' (not 'deploy') and does not support
--sandbox-launcher. An Instance created via alpha will lack sandbox support
and the server will crash on startup.

# Both _DI_TOKENINFO_URL and _DI_API_BASE are TEST-ONLY seams, and both carry
# the ADC token: tokeninfo takes it in a query string, and the API base takes
# it in a Bearer header on a GET *and* on the step 3b PATCH — a mutating call.
# One rule covers both: the host must be one of Google's own or loopback (a
# stub that cannot move the token off the machine).
#
# EXTRACTING THE HOST IS THE WHOLE JOB, and getting it nearly right is worse
# than not checking at all, because a bypassable check gets documented as a
# guarantee. A previous version stripped only the path, so
# 'https://evil.example?.googleapis.com' was ALLOWED — and curl connects to
# the host before the '?', so the Bearer token was delivered to the attacker.
# Everything after the first /, ?, # or \ must go, and userinfo must go too
# (curl resolves the host after the LAST '@'). This function has a
# table-driven test; extend it before touching anything here.
#
# A HOST ALLOWLIST IS NOT A URL ALLOWLIST, and the difference is not cosmetic:
# a *permitted* host carrying a path plus a trailing '&z=' retargets the step
# 3b PATCH at another project's Instance, with the operator's live token and a
# valid updateMask, leaving the operator's own Instance with IAP off. That is
# why the '?'/'#' guard below is a check and not a comment. Any residual
# exposure here is harmless because an actor who can set these variables can
# already run arbitrary code — NOT because only loopback is permitted, which
# is reasoning about hosts and does not cover the path.
