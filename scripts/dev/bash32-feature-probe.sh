# bash32-feature-probe.sh — measure which bash 4+ constructs bash 3.2.57 accepts
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. .design/hosted/cloud-run-single-node.md carried a row headed
# "Measured" listing ten constructs absent from bash 3.2.57. The version string
# was measured on real Darwin hardware. The feature list beside it was written
# from version history and placed under a header that says it was measured. That
# is the exact false-prose class this branch has already spent three review
# rounds on. This script settles it on real hardware.
#
# THE TRAP. Several of these are PARSE errors in 3.2, not runtime errors. A
# parse error aborts the entire script before line one executes. If you probe
# them in one script you will not measure ten constructs — you will measure one
# parse failure and get a tidy table of nine "unsupported" results that were
# never run. That failure mode produces exactly the output you are expecting,
# which is why it will not look wrong.
#
# So each construct is probed in its own separate subprocess: one
# `bash -c '<construct>'` per construct, with exit status and stderr captured
# separately.
#
# Usage:  scripts/dev/bash32-feature-probe.sh
#         SCION_TEST_BASH=/bin/bash scripts/dev/bash32-feature-probe.sh
