/**
 * Browser counter budgets for the project agent page: grid, list and graph
 * views at 100 generated agents (fixture.mjs, see mock-api.ts).
 *
 * Per view: one warm-up load (not measured; it lets the dev server
 * transform and cache the modules), then LOADS measured loads, then one
 * load with the CPU slowed SLOW_CPU_RATE times, each in a fresh browser
 * context. A load is measured once the view has written its readiness mark
 * (READY_MARK, turned on in the mocked page data), has rendered its agents
 * (25 cards or rows on the first page of the grid and list, 100 graph
 * nodes), its lazily mounted Files section has been scrolled into view
 * (otherwise whether it mounts depends on load speed), and its deep DOM
 * count is the same on three reads 500 ms apart. The page's Date is pinned
 * to FIXED_NOW (its timers and animation frames are left alone; the
 * readiness marks need them).
 * The slowed load must settle on the same DOM count as the normal ones, so
 * the gate cannot depend on how fast the runner is.
 *
 * Counters:
 * - domElements: every element in the document, including inside shadow
 *   roots (the countAllDeep walk from large-project-bench.mjs). The
 *   fixture has fixed IDs and times and the page's Date is pinned
 *   (FIXED_NOW), so this is exact for a given web build and fixture;
 *   every measured load must stay within the limit.
 * - longTasks: main-thread tasks over 50 ms (PerformanceObserver
 *   'longtask') from navigation until the measurement. This is the one
 *   host-sensitive counter here: it depends on runner CPU and load. The
 *   gate uses the median over the LOADS loads and a wide margin, so one
 *   noisy load cannot fail CI.
 *
 * Baselines were measured on BASELINE_COMMIT, Chromium headless shell,
 * one worker:
 * - domElements: identical on all loads per view, slowed ones included
 *   (12 loads on main 7049f53, 9 more on main 48a6715).
 * - longTasks: the median of the 6 normal loads of 2 runs on main
 *   48a6715, rounded up (grid 3-7, list 3-7, graph 4-9 per load),
 *   so that no run median (up to 7 in every view) sits within 1 of its
 *   limit.
 * Limits:
 * - domElements: baseline + DOM_MARGIN elements. One extra element per
 *   rendered card or row adds 25 (grid, list) or 100 (graph) and fails.
 * - longTasks: baseline + max(3, 50% of baseline, rounded up). Eight added
 *   120 ms tasks at startup measured medians of 13-15 and fail.
 *
 * Updating a budget for an intended change: run
 *   npm run test:e2e:perf-budgets
 * read the "measured" lines, set the baseline below and say why in the
 * commit message (docs-site/src/content/docs/contributing/perf-tracing.md).
