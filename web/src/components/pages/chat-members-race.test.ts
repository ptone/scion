/**
 * Regression test: loadV2Members and refreshHubMemberPresence used to
 * assign/merge into the sidebar member arrays unconditionally once their
 * fetch resolved, with no check that the view which started the request was
 * still the active one. A later-started, earlier-resolving
 * request would then be clobbered by an earlier-started, later-resolving
 * one.
 *
 * loadV2Members and refreshHubMemberPresence are guarded by
 * `_membersViewSeq`, which loadV2Members and loadHubMembers both bump. The
 * hub loads (the users walk, and the agent store's hub list) are guarded by
 * their own `v2Conversation`/generation checks instead; the hub cases below
 * pin that a stale hub load still cannot overwrite a project view, whichever
 * guard does it. Cases, in `it` order:
 *
 *  1. Switching from project A to project B before A's response arrives —
 *     A's stale response must not overwrite B's members.
 *  2. Leaving a project for the hub view while a late project response
 *     arrives — it must not overwrite the hub members.
 *  3. A stale project response whose headers resolve — via an explicit
 *     macrotask flush that lets the first load's headers settle before the
 *     second load starts — but whose body (`res.json()`) only resolves after
 *     the newer load has already finished and written the sidebar. This pins
 *     the guard's *position*: it must run after the body is read, not
 *     merely after the headers, or this case cannot fail.
 *  4. The same as case 2, but the hub call only joins a walk that is already
 *     in flight — loadHubMembers must still claim the sidebar for the hub,
 *     so the late project response is discarded.
 *  5. Leaving the hub for a project while a hub walk is in flight — the walk
 *     landing late must not overwrite the project members.
 *  6. The same race as case 5, but with the hub users response's body
 *     deferred until after the project has written the sidebar.
 *  7. A late hub-presence merge landing after the user has moved to a
 *     project — it must not merge onto the project's members.
 *  8. The same race as case 7, but with the presence response's body
 *     deferred — pins that refreshHubMemberPresence's guard must run after
 *     its body is read, not merely after its headers.
