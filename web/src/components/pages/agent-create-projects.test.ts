/**
 * Which projects the Create Agent picker asks for (#106).
 *
 * The picker used `mine=true`, which the Hub resolves to projects where the
 * caller holds the project-owner role specifically. Creating an agent does not
 * require ownership — project-member carries `agent.create`, and the create
 * endpoint authorizes against the target project — so every project a member
 * belonged to was missing from the picker and they could not create an agent
 * anywhere, with no error to explain it.
 *
 * This pins the request, because the defect is entirely in what is asked for:
 * the response handling was always correct.
