/**
 * Chat page component — top-level chat mode.
 *
 * Wave-2 Architecture (default, web.native_chat_v2 ON):
 *
 * This is the primary entry point for Native Chat. Wave-2 adds shared spaces
 * (one per project), multi-participant threads, DMs (agent and human),
 * a members sidebar with presence indicators, typing indicators,
 * notifications, file attachments, and message search.
 *
 * Key design decisions:
 * - **Dual-dialect store**: webchat_topic, webchat_read_state, webchat_dm,
 *   webchat_user_prefs tables (SQLite + Postgres) for chat-specific state.
 *   Messages live in the existing messages table with ThreadID as the routing key.
 * - **One persistence path**: messages are persisted once via the hub's
 *   inprocess spoke; the web channel bus only updates watermarks.
 * - **SSE via stateManager**: a single multiplexed SSE connection per client
 *   replaces per-thread EventSource streams. Events are project-scoped.
 * - **Feature flag**: `web.native_chat_v2` (default ON as of W9). Setting
 *   it OFF reverts to the wave-1 agent-per-thread UI for rollback safety.
 *
 * Renders inside `<scion-chat-shell>` and supports two modes:
 *
 * **V1 (web.native_chat_v2 OFF):**
 * - Thread rail listing agents with last-message preview and unread dot
 * - `/chat` shows the rail with no thread selected
 * - `/chat/:agentId` opens the thread for that agent
 *
 * **V2 (web.native_chat_v2 ON):**
 * - Space rail (chat-space-rail) with project grouping, threads, DMs
 * - Conversation view keyed by conversationKey (topic UUID or DM key)
 * - Routes: `/chat`, `/chat/space/{projectId}`, `/chat/space/{projectId}/thread/{topicId}`, `/chat/dm/{key}`
 * - Members sidebar with presence, typing indicators, search panel
