/**
 * Chat page component — top-level chat mode.
 *
 * This is the primary entry point for Native Chat: shared spaces (one per
 * project), multi-participant threads, DMs (agent and human), a members
 * sidebar with presence indicators, typing indicators, notifications, file
 * attachments, and message search.
 *
 * Key design decisions:
 * - **Dual-dialect store**: webchat_topic, webchat_read_state, webchat_dm,
 *   webchat_user_prefs tables (SQLite + Postgres) for chat-specific state.
 *   Messages live in the existing messages table with ThreadID as the routing key.
 * - **One persistence path**: messages are persisted once via the hub's
 *   inprocess spoke; the web channel bus only updates watermarks.
 * - **SSE via stateManager**: a single multiplexed SSE connection per client
 *   replaces per-thread EventSource streams. Events are project-scoped.
 *
 * Renders inside `<scion-chat-shell>`:
 * - Space rail (chat-space-rail) with project grouping, threads, DMs
 * - Conversation view keyed by conversationKey (topic UUID or DM key)
 * - Routes: `/chat`, `/chat/space/{projectId}`, `/chat/space/{projectId}/thread/{topicId}`, `/chat/dm/{key}`
 * - Members sidebar with presence, typing indicators, search panel
