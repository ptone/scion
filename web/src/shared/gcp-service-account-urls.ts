/**
 * THE ONE PLACE THAT CHOOSES A SERVICE ACCOUNT'S ADDRESS.
 *
 * A GCP service account has two possible addresses and the choice is not the
 * caller's to make freely:
 *
 *   - project-scoped -> /api/v1/projects/{scionProjectId}/gcp-service-accounts/{id}
 *   - hub- or user-scoped -> /api/v1/gcp-service-accounts/{id}
 *
 * Hub- and user-scoped accounts are PARENTLESS. The flat route exists because
 * they have no project to be nested under, and it answers 404 -- not 403 -- for
 * a project-scoped id, so an address chosen wrongly does not fail loudly, it
 * fails as "no such account".
 *
 * THE TRAP THIS MODULE CLOSES is the same one pkg/hubclient closed with
 * GCPServiceAccount.Ref(): the account carries BOTH `scopeId` (the Scion
 * project that owns the registration) and `projectId` (the GCP project the
 * service account itself lives in). The obvious line
 *
 *     `/api/v1/projects/${account.projectId}/gcp-service-accounts/${account.id}`
 *
 * reads correctly, uses the field whose name matches the path segment, and
 * 404s. So callers do not assemble these paths; they call saRef(account) and
 * let the account's own scope pick the address, exactly as the Go client does.
 */
