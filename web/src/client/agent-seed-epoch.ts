/**
 * The seed-epoch protocol for one agents request that seeds the state
 * store (a sorted first request, a paged page request, a legacy list).
 *
 * Open an {@link AgentSeedEpoch} before the request is sent, call
 * {@link AgentSeedEpoch.seed} with the response, and {@link
 * AgentSeedEpoch.close} in a `finally`. While open it:
 * - holds a state-store seed epoch, so a live delta that arrives while the
 *   request is in flight is re-applied over the (older) response rows
 *   instead of being overwritten by them;
 * - records the IDs created live, so a create that the response predates
 *   is still part of the membership a page renders;
 * - records every ID upserted live, so a page that adopts a fresh member
 *   index or server page can replay those changes into it;
 * - records the merged delta of every ID changed live while not in the
 *   store, so a page whose counts or member index come from the response
 *   can replay it (see {@link AgentSeedEpoch.unknownChanges});
 * - records the IDs deleted live, so a page whose member index or counts
 *   come from the response can replay those deletes (see
 *   {@link AgentSeedEpoch.deletedChanges});
 * - records whether any live change landed at all, for a page that holds
 *   counts it cannot adjust (see {@link AgentSeedEpoch.sawChanges});
 * - records whether the live connection resynced (`agents-resync`), after
 *   which the response may predate changes the connection missed (see
 *   {@link AgentSeedEpoch.sawResync}).
