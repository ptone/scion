 * deltas one at a time through `mergeAgentDelta`, for *any* `base` supplied
 * later, which is why folding deltas into this instead of keeping the raw
 * list is safe: a long-lived off-page agent emits status events
 * indefinitely while still unknown to `state.agents` (that is what
 * `dirty.unknown` exists for), so an append-only list would grow without
 * bound.
 *
 * `fields` covers every field except `activity`. Each delta is promoted
 * via `promoteDetailFields` before folding, so `applyCompactedDelta`
 * replays `fields` with `skipPromote`. Promoting again would re-derive
 * top-level fields from the last raw `detail` and overwrite later values.
 * The one exception is `_capabilities`:
 * `mergeAgentDelta` keeps the base's truthy value when a delta's own is
 * falsy (`null`/absent), so folding must apply that same rule against the
 * accumulator's current value, not just overwrite it — see
 * `foldCompactedDelta`/`composeCompactedDeltas`. Every other field never
 * depends on what `base` turns out to be, so folding it eagerly, in
 * arrival order, is exact — including an explicit `undefined` on a field
 * other than `activity`, which plain object spread already clears to
 * `undefined` at every step, live or compacted, with no special handling.
 *
 * `activity` is the one field whose resolved value *can* depend on
 * `base.activity`'s stickiness — but only up to the first delta in the run
 * that sets it to something other than `working` or `''` ("unlocking"):
 * that includes an explicit `activity: undefined`, since `mergeAgentDelta`
 * never suppresses a missing/`undefined` incoming activity either, so it
 * always clears straight through to `undefined`, independent of the base,
 * same as any other concrete unlocking value. `mergeAgentDelta`'s
 * suppression check only ever fires for an incoming `working`/`''`, and
 * only when the *current* activity is sticky, so once an unlocking delta
 * sets a value (`undefined` included), every later step's suppression
 * check uses that value (or whatever has replaced it since) — never
 * `base.activity` again. From that point on the result is base-independent
 * and can be resolved immediately. Before the first unlock, `pending` holds
 * the most recent `working`/`''` activity seen so far, or `undefined` if no
 * delta has touched `activity` at all yet (in which case `base.activity`
 * must pass through untouched — see `applyCompactedDelta`). After the
 * first unlock, `value` holds the current resolved activity (`undefined`
 * included), updated the same way on every subsequent delta, now using
 * `value` itself (not `base.activity`) as the thing a `working`/`''` delta
 * might be suppressed by.

   * is cleared unconditionally, for every seed, tokened or not — see

   * agent is seeded, so a caller's own `endSeedEpoch` afterward (per the
   * §8 pseudocode) is a harmless no-op. Do not call
   * `seedAgents` more than once with the same token expecting the epoch to
   * still be open.
   *
   * `partial: true` merges each object into the existing one instead of
   * replacing it, so a compact-view seed cannot strip full fields a fuller
   * seed already recorded (§6.3).
