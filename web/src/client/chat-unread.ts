/**
 * Unread conversation count: the chat mode badge in the header and the tab
 * title badge show the same number.
 *
 * The number comes from `GET /api/v1/chat/unread-count`, whose
 * `conversations` field counts the caller's unread, unmuted conversations
 * (member threads plus DMs). The server owns membership and muting, so this
 * module never filters or adds anything itself.
 *
 * It refreshes, debounced, on every chat message and read-state event, and
 * whenever the chat page reports that its own lists changed (the user read
 * or muted something in this tab, which the server does not echo back).
 *
 * Every page subscribes to the user's own chat subject, and the hub sends
 * there everything that can move the count: DM messages, thread messages
 * to the thread's members (`user.<id>.chat.message`), and the user's own
 * reads, mutes and mark-unreads (`user.<id>.chat.read-state`). A thread
 * message also arrives on its project subject when the page subscribes to
 * that; the debounce folds the two copies into one request.
 *
 * A failed request (an error status included) keeps the last count and is
 * not retried; the next event asks again.
 *
 * Cost control. The count is as heavy as the rail's space list (it is the
 * same rollup), so the counter avoids asking more than it must:
 *
 * - At most one request is in flight; events during it fold into a single
 *   trailing refresh.
 * - Tabs share answers. A refresh runs under a Web Lock and records its
 *   answer, with the user it is for and when the oldest request behind it
 *   started, in localStorage; a tab of the same user whose triggering event
 *   came before that adopts the answer instead of asking again. N tabs
 *   reacting to one event send one request.
 * - Every answer is bounded (UNREAD_ASK_TIMEOUT_MS): a hung request is
 *   abandoned as a failure, releasing the lock and the single flight.
 * - The chat page installs a source (`setSource`) that derives the count
 *   from the shared `/chat/spaces` and `/chat/dms` loads the rail and page
 *   already make for the same event, so on the chat page a message costs
 *   no extra rollup. The hub pins `unread-count` to exactly that sum
 *   (TestChatUnreadCount_BadgeEqualsRail).
