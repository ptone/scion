/**
 * Agent list window: the state machine behind a paginated agent list
 * (project page grid, list and tree views).
 *
 * States:
 * - `small`: the host holds the complete set H (a fit response with
 *   `complete: true`, or a one-page legacy load). Everything is local.
 * - `paged`: server-sorted pages of a sorted-eligible view state, with a
 *   member index for live counts.
 * - `held`: the complete set H from a multi-page drain. Local, like small,
 *   and kept for the page lifetime until a refresh trigger.
 * - `capped`: an incomplete H from a drain that hit its request cap, or
 *   whose later page failed. Local, like held, but flagged incomplete.
 *
 * The window never issues a first request itself: the host asks
 * {@link AgentListWindow.planRequest} which request a trigger needs, sends
 * it, and reports the outcome with `setSmall`, `setPaged` or `adoptDrain`.
 * Only paged navigation (`next`, `prev`, `refresh`) fetches, through the
 * host's `fetchPage`.
 *
 * The local states never copy H: they read it fresh, by reference, from
 * `getHeldAgents()` on every access, so whatever the host's live-update
 * path last assigned is visible at once, with no re-adoption step and no
 * `pageIndex` reset. `pageIndex` resets to 0 on a `setViewState` call in a
 * local state, and on any move out of `paged` (a different data set).
