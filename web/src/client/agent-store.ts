/**
 * Shared agent-list store.
 *
 * Owns fetching, pagination, coalescing, completeness and lifetime of agent
 * lists, keyed by query. Every surface that needs "the agents of the hub" (or
 * of one project) asks the store instead of walking the list endpoint itself,
 * so a list is fetched once and then kept current from SSE.
 *
 * Lists are walked in the server's compact view. A compact row merges into
 * the feed's row for that agent and never strips the fields a full row
 * holds; the feed is the store's own, so compact rows never reach the
 * global `stateManager`.
 *
 * Live updates come from a store-owned feed: a dedicated {@link StateManager}
 * on the `agent-feed` scope, which subscribes to `project.*.agent.>`. Its
 * scope never changes, so page navigation (which re-scopes the global
 * `stateManager`) cannot wipe it. All delta merging, unknown-delta buffering,
 * tombstones, seed epochs and the completeness flag are the feed's own.
 *
 * Contract highlights:
 * - `ensure` on a ready, fresh entry answers from memory with no request,
 *   also while a walk the probe started runs in the background.
 *   Concurrent `ensure` calls for one key share one walk.
 * - A caller's abort signal detaches only that caller. A walk is aborted
 *   only when it has neither waiters nor retainers.
 * - `complete` is true only after a full walk succeeded; a walk cut off by
 *   the page bound is `ready` but not complete. Loading snapshots are never
 *   complete. A walk the probe starts leaves the snapshot as it is until it
 *   succeeds; if it fails, the snapshot stays as it was and the probe goes
 *   on.
 * - Every walk is a seeded walk: deltas that arrive while it runs are
 *   reapplied on top of its REST rows, and tombstoned agents never return.
 * - While the feed is down, or an entry is stale, `ensure` revalidates
 *   rather than answering from memory.
 * - A retained hub or unfiltered project list is probed every 30s (±3s)
 *   while the page is visible, for changes SSE does not carry: one compact
 *   page of the 50 most recently active rows (by last activity time, else
 *   `updated`), applied as a seeded merge. It walks once when it cannot
 *   catch up in five pages or when the server's count differs from the rows
 *   held. A probe never sets the completeness flag. A probe due five minutes
 *   or more after the list's last walk began walks instead.
