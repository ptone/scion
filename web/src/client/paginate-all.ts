/**
 * Generic cursor-pagination walker for `nextCursor`-paginated list endpoints.
 *
 * Fetches every page of a list endpoint via `apiFetch`, following
 * `nextCursor` until it is empty — not until a page's `items` are empty,
 * since a filtered intermediate page can legitimately return zero items
 * while still carrying a cursor. A cursor value repeating across pages is
 * treated as a load error rather than looping forever, and a safety bound on
 * page count guards against a server bug that never terminates. Each page
 * request, including reading its body, is bounded by a timeout: when it
 * expires the request is aborted through its signal and the walk rejects,
 * instead of a request that never settles leaving it pending forever.
 *
 * This mirrors the users pagination contract implemented by
 * `chat-palette-data.ts`'s `fetchAllPaletteUsers`; it is factored out here
 * so full-list consumers (the agent store, `chat.ts`'s hub members sidebar)
 * don't hand-roll the same cursor loop.
 *
 * The existing generic helper `apiFetchAllPages` (`api.ts`) is not reused
 * because it returns a partial list when a later page fails, silently stops
 * after 50 pages, and offers no way to stop the walk early.
