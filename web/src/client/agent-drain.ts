/**
 * Complete-set agent drain.
 *
 * Two layers:
 *
 * - {@link drainAgents} walks the legacy (`created desc`, no `sort` param)
 *   agent list by following `nextCursor`, at most {@link DRAIN_MAX_REQUESTS}
 *   requests of {@link DRAIN_PAGE_LIMIT} rows each, retrying each page up to
 *   {@link DRAIN_PAGE_RETRIES} times. It is a pure network walk: it touches
 *   no shared state.
 * - {@link AgentDrainRunner} runs that walk inside the seed-epoch protocol of
 *   the client state store, so that live (SSE) changes that land while the
 *   walk is in flight are neither overwritten by the older REST snapshot nor
 *   lost: it waits briefly for the live connection, opens a seed epoch,
 *   drains, seeds the result with the epoch token, then folds in agents
 *   created live during the walk and drops agents deleted live during it.
 *
 * Neither layer ever reports a set as complete unless the walk reached a
 * page with no `nextCursor`. A cap, an error, or an abort is always visible
 * in the result.
