/**
 * Tests for scope-capability caching (#98).
 *
 * Agent-scope and project-scope capabilities are different vocabularies, and
 * the Hub computes them with separate calls. They used to share one slot, so
 * the Projects page's answer could be read back by the Agents page — which
 * decides whether "New Agent" renders. `setScope` clears the cache, but both
 * pages declare the same `dashboard` scope, so it early-returns between them
 * and the stale value survived.
 *
 * These tests pin the property that actually matters: a read for one resource
 * never returns what was written for another.
