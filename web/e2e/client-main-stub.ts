/**
 * Shared by the chat-palette and chat-file-preview e2e fixtures: a stand-in
 * for `src/client/main.ts`, served in its place at the network layer.
 *
 * chat.ts (and chat-members.ts/chat-thread.ts) import `navigateTo`,
 * `replaceRoute`, `pushRoute` and `stateManager` from `client/main.js` — the
 * app's real bootstrap module, which self-initializes on `DOMContentLoaded`
 * (SSR hydration, feature-flag fetch, the full page router, admin-status
 * probe...) the instant anything imports it, real hub or not. Those fixtures
 * deliberately do not run that router/bootstrap (they mount the page
 * component directly), so the module is replaced with the minimal real
 * surface those components actually call — the browser-test equivalent of
 * `vi.mock('../../client/main.js', ...)` in the vitest unit tests, and kept in
 * step with `src/client/__fixtures__/state-stub.ts`.
 *
 * The stub is written in TypeScript and typed against the real
 * `StateManager` and `main.ts` exports, so a change to any stubbed member's
 * name or signature is a typecheck error here rather than a silent drift.
 * The browser receives each declaration's own source text (`toString()`),
 * so the stub bodies must use only browser globals: no imports, no closures
 * over module values, and no class fields (methods and accessors only), so a
 * transform has no reason to inject helpers into them.
